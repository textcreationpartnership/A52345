            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He deſign of this Treatiſe is no other, then what all muſt own to be the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and general concern of mankind, which is, to be well read in <hi>the difference between things temporal and eternal.</hi> This is the Subject; this the Title of the Book. The original (which hath already paſſed, there the teſt of ten Editions) we owe to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the pious and learned labours of the late <hi>Euſebius Nieremberg,</hi> who hath often
<pb facs="tcp:51068:3"/>obliged the world by the like fruits of his zealous Pen. After having been read and approved in divers other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it hath now learned to ſpeak Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, having been lately tranſlated (by a noble and worthy perſon, Sir <hi>Vivian Mullineaux</hi>) for the ſervice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and accordingly reſolves (if it may be but ſo happy as to deſerve the gracious favour of your Majeſties roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Patronage) to adventure abroad for the benefit of all pious and well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, whether Catholique or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Readers. All which may be here duly informed, as of <hi>the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things temporal and eternal,</hi> ſo of the different and cautionary wayes they ought to purſue in dividing themſelves and their hearts between both. Time and Eternity are points of good and wholeſome uſe to all wiſe and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent contemplations. Time indeed got the ſtart of Man at the Creation, and is five dayes elder then he. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Man ſtill lives in hopes, he ſhall at long-run overtake, and even out-live
<pb facs="tcp:51068:3"/>Time. And this ſhall be when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſurrection ſhall have reſtored him to his better and glorified ſelf, <hi>and all that is mortal in him ſhall have put on immortality.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53.</note> Man then being like to prove the longer liver of the two, Time cannot (nor indeed any thing that ſhall periſh with Time) be that great end, for which Man was finally ordained. That onely can be Man's end, which hath none it ſelf; and that is Eternity: a happy Eternity; the laſt article of our Creed, and the laſt end of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sure then it behooves us to be wary Gameſters, when Eternity is at ſtake: and not careleſly to throw away our affections at a venture, or heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to engage our hearts, here and there, upon every ſlight invitation from ſenſe and fancy: but to proceed adviſedly in the choice of our object, and in <hi>the difference we make between things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal;</hi> This very <hi>difference</hi> being the nice pin, and tickliſh point, which ſhall unappealably decide the
<pb facs="tcp:51068:4"/>caſe of all we have to hope or fear in the world to come, by giving ſentence at the laſt day of our final weal or woe. For we are to be judged by our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and every man ſhall ſtand, or fall by the verdict of his own heart. So that the main point, which ſhall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference our dooms, is the different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications we make to things temporal, or eternal, cauſing this man's lot to fall to the right hand, the others to the left. MADAM, this addreſs is farr from pretending to the uſuall Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſtrain, in complementing the great name, whoſe Patronage it implores: or enlarging upon thoſe truly-Chriſtian, and Princely accompliſhments, (your great and eminent vertues,) which more adorn your Majeſty, then Majeſty can your Perſon. Theſe are a ſubject for a higher undertaking, then this ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory dares pretend to. Onely, with your Majeſties permiſſion, thus much I ſhall make bold to ſay, that your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and exemplar piety, attended
<pb facs="tcp:51068:4"/>with ſo many other rich endowments of grace, clearly ſpeaks you Miſtreſs of a Soul throughly acquainted with <hi>the Difference between things temporal and eternal.</hi> Hence it is, that none of the moſt courting allurements of this life, however great in themſelves, can ſeem truly ſuch to your greater heart. Your Chriſtian ends and deſigns take a nobler flight: they are not limited to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of a viſible Sphere; they act upon motives fetched from another world, and harbour not a thought, which can ſit down, and fix on this ſide Eternity. Though I love not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical, yet methinks the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath a word of comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for your Majeſty, even where it might be leaſt expected from the outward letter, to countenance the application.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan</hi> 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>They that inſtruct many to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarrs for ever and ever.</hi> So ſpeaks this great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Oracle of <hi>Judah.</hi> Here is a boundleſs promiſe, and Heaven ſtands
<pb facs="tcp:51068:5"/>engaged for the performance; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſingle happineſs of ſhining like the ſtarrs <hi>for ever:</hi> but the double bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>for ever, and ever.</hi> I humbly conceive, this ſo highly-rewardable teaching and inſtructing others to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, may, without violence to the Text, be taken in a twofold ſenſe. For, not onely the uſeful and practical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Divinity-chair, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and the Man of elocution, but alſo the pious, though ſilent deeds of the good Liver, are our Teachers and Inſtructors. For that perſon (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if a publick perſon) inſtructs well, who lives well: and the good dumb work hath oftentimes more of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive faculty in it, than either pen or tongue can match. This, Madam, is your Majeſties caſe: this, your, nay our happineſs, if we underſtand it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Your life is a noble School of Vertue, and reads us a fair Lecture of a more then ordinary Chriſtianity, far beyond the cold inſtructions of Book
<pb facs="tcp:51068:5"/>or Pulpit. They onely utter words; you ſpeak examples. <hi>England</hi> hath heard, and the holy Altars have often witneſſed the fervour of your Majeſties devotions; whileſt you ſpend whole nights in paying the faithful homage of heart and knee to the greateſt of all Majeſties, Almighty God. So that the ſevere duties of Prayer, Watching, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Mortification, frequent Retreats to a more free and undiſturbed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Heaven, are now adopted Court-Vertues in the ſanctity of your Majeſties Royal Perſon. All which makes me ſay, that ſuch, and ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-inſtructive a life will (if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pleaſe to lend me his expreſſion) entitle your Majeſty not onely to one, but (were it poſſible) to a plurality of Eternities. Live then,<note place="margin">So the vulgar Edition renders it, <hi>in per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putuas aeternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
               </note> (moſt pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) live, and be ſtill your great Self; great in Majeſty: greater for for piety: and greateſt in the contempt of all temporal greatneſs, compared with eternal. May the ſame ſweet Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

And when our ſins ſhall envy us the happineſs of your Majeſties longer reſidence upon earth, and the inexorable Decree ſhall ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you to pay the common debt, which all of us (Prince as well as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) owe to the ſin of our firſt Parents, May you then, being tranſlated hence to the embraces of your Creator, experimentally finde the <hi>true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between things temporal and eternal,</hi> in the blisful viſion and fruition of our great All our all-mighty, all-lovely, all-glorious God; who is all wonders at one ſight, all joyes and comforts in their ſourſe, all bleſſings in their center; the end of all labours, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all ſervices, the deſire of all hearts, and the accompliſhment of all hopes and wiſhes. May he then be to

                     </note> that as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> notes; they take the baniſhment of this life for their home, the darkneſs of humane wiſdom for light, and this wandring peregrination here for their reſt and abode; all which proceeds from ignorance of the truth, and the ſmall conſideration of what is eternal; in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they qualifie what is good with the name of bad, and what is bad with the name of good; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which confuſion in humane judgment <hi>David</hi> asked of the Lord, that he would give him a Maſter who might inſtruct him, which is the true good, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who ſhall teach us what is good?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The world is therefore ignorant of all things, even of its own proper goods, which it moſt enjoyes; it faring with us, as it did with the Children of Iſrael, who having Manna in their ſight, and holding it in their hands, yet knew it not, but demanded, <hi>What is this?</hi> but unto us even that curioſity is wanting: we enquire not ſo much as what theſe riches are, for which mortal men hazard ſo many dangers of death; what honours are, for which mens hearts burſt with envy and ambition; what pleaſures are, for which we endanger our health, and often loſe our lives; what the goods of the earth are, which are onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed during our pilgrimage, in the exile of this life,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51068:10"/>and are to vaniſh at the entrance of the other, as Manna did at the entrance of the Land of Promiſe. With reaſon did Chriſt our Redeemer in <hi>Apocalyps</hi> call it the hidden Manna, becauſe the Hebrews holding it in their hands, knew not what it was: even ſo are the things of this life hidden unto our underſtandings, which although we touch, we know not: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their value, do that for things temporal, which we onely ought to do for the eternal, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing theſe for the eſteem of thoſe, which for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are worthy to be deſpiſed and contemned.</p>
                  <p>Hence failing in the knowledge of things, we fail in their eſtimation, and conſequently in their uſe. That which happens in this, may be likewiſe ſeen in thoſe, who did eat Manna; for unto ſome it cauſed a loathing, and procured vomit; unto others it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted pleaſantly, and like the meat they moſt deſired. So great difference is there betwixt the good and ill uſe of things: and the good uſe of all depends upon their knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Let mortal men therefore awake and open their eyes, and let them know the difference betwixt what is temporal, and eternal, that they may give to every thing its due eſtimation, deſpiſing that which time makes an end of, and eſteeming that which eternity preſerves; the which they ought to ſeek during this life, and by theſe momentary things purchaſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, unto which they cannot attain without the knowledge both of the one and the other; becauſe aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the eternal as that of greateſt value, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the temporal, although of it ſelf of no worth, and that which is corruptible and tranſitory they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der firm and durable.</p>
                  <p>The Manna alſo, which our Lord gave unto the Hebrews whileſt they wandered in the Deſert, and was to ſerve them until their arrival in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, amongſt other myſterious ſignifications which it contained, one was to be a Symbol of the bleſſings

                     </note> as is well noted by <hi>Baldwin</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctor, and a moſt learned Interpreter of the holy Scripture.

                  <p>Some Philoſophers, who conſidered better the things of this life, although without attention unto the eternal, found in them many defects; the which the moſt wiſe Emperor and Philoſopher <hi>Aurelius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> reduced unto three,<note place="margin">In vita ſua.</note> to wit, that they are little, mutable, and corruptible even until they arrive unto their end; all which we ſhall find repreſented to life in Manna.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51068:11"/>requiſite for the uſe of it. After the ſame manner the goods of this life, notwithſtanding all their faults and evil conditions, are not obtained, nor enjoyed without much travel and vexation. After this all did not enjoy that quality proper to Manna, which was, to taſte like unto that, which he that eat it moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for ſinners found this taſte limited, and not ſo full and ſavory as others. Even ſo we with our vices alter and diminiſh the natural ſweetneſs of the things of this life, as we ſhall ſee hereafter in it's due place. It is true that the appearance of it was good,<note place="margin">Sept.

                  <p>Let us then leave the appearance and painted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of things, and look upon the ſubſtance and truth, and we ſhall finde that what is temporal is ſmall, and what eternal is great; the temporal inconſtant, the eternal firm; the temporal ſhort and temporal, the eternal durable, and in fine eternal: and this onely were enough to make it more eſteemed then the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, although the temporal in all other reſpects did exceed it; but the one being ſo ſhort and mutable, and the other great, firm and conſtant, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them can be no leſs,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> moral. c. <hi>12.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe thought of Eternity St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls a Great thought,<note place="margin">Auguſ. in Pſal. <hi>76.</hi> Magna cogit.</note> becauſe the memory of it is of great joy unto the Saints, and no leſs horror unto Sinners, and unto both of much profit and concernment: it cauſes us to do great matters, and ſhews the ſmalneſs of the fading and tranſitory things of this earth. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this light begin to diſcover the large field of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51068:12"/>the poverty, trumpery, and baſeneſs of the temporal, and recommend the conſideration of the eternal, the which we ought ſtill to have in our thoughts, as <hi>David</hi> had perpetually in his; in whom whilſt he was a Sinner, it cauſed horror and confuſion, and being a Saint, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and encouraged him to be yet more holy, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this meditation moſt ſpiritual and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable profit unto his ſoul; and therefore in his Pſalms he ſo often repeats the memory of it, not only in the body of them, but almoſt in every paſſage, ſaying, <hi>for ever,</hi> or <hi>eternally,</hi> or <hi>world without end:</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no inſcription or title which he uſes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then this, <hi>againſt the end,</hi> or <hi>in the end,</hi> becauſe he compoſed them with the conſideration of eternity, which follows the end of this life; and for more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs adds in ſome of them, <hi>againſt the end: for the Octave;</hi> which according to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſignifies E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, that being the octave after the 7 dayes of the week, into which all time is to reſolve, which 7 dayes being paſt, there are to be no more weeks, but, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, one onely day of perpetual Eternity.</p>
                  <p>In this Eternity therefore did the Prophet employ his thoughts by day, and his meditations by night; this forced him to ſend up his voice unto Heaven, and to cry out unto God; this made him mute, and took away his ſpeech with men; this aſtoniſhed him and made his pulſes fail with the conſideration of it; this affrighted him, and mingled wormwood with the pleaſures of this life; this made him know the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that is temporal, and made him enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, and examine his conſcience: Finally, this brought him to a moſt miraculous change of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſerve the Lord with more fervor; all which effects proceeding from the thoughts of Eternity are apparent in the 76 Pſalm; therefore ſayes he amongſt other things, <hi>Mine eyes prevented the watches, I troubled myſelf and ſpake not:</hi> immediately after he gives the reaſon, ſaying, <hi>I thought upon the dayes of old, and had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51068:13"/>in my thoughts the years of eternity, and meditated on them by night with my heart.</hi> This thought was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his long watches; on this he meditated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun was riſen, and on this many hours after it was ſet, and that with ſo great aſtoniſhment of what Eternity was, that his ſpirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

And it is no marvel though this great thought of Eternity ſhould make ſo holy a King to tremble, when as the Prophet <hi>Abuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Philoſophers more barbarous, and who had leſs light, were yet daunted with the conception of it, and in their Symbols made choice of things of the greateſt of terror to expreſs it: ſome painted it in the form of a Baſilisk, a Serpent the moſt terrible of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who kills with his onely ſight; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more horror, then that eternity of torments, whereinto we are ſubject to fall. Conformable to this St. <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> repreſented eternal duration under the figure of a fierce Dragon, which from a deep pit lay waiting with open jawes to ſwallow men alive. Others figured it by a horrible and profound Cavern, which at the entrance had four degrees, one of iron, another of braſs, the third of ſilver, and the laſt of gold, upon which many little Children of ſeveral ſexes and ages ſtood playing and paſſing away the time, without regarding the danger of falling into that bottomleſs dungeon. This ſhadow they framed not only to ſet forth how worthy Eternity was of their fear and amazement, but alſo to expreſs their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51068:13"/>amazement at the folly of men, who laugh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with the things of this life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remembring that they are to die, and may then fall into the bottomleſs abyſs of Hell. Thoſe children who were playing at the entrance of that diſmal cave, being no other than men in this life, whoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but thoſe of children, and who being ſo near their death, and therefore unto Eternity which ſucceeds it, have neither fear, nor care to leave the pleaſures and vain entertainments of this world. Truly it is a thing of great amazement, that being in expectation of two ſuch extreams, as are eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and torments without end, we live as if there were neither. The reaſon is, becauſe men ſet not themſelves ſeriouſly to conſider what Eternity is, which is either hell whileſt God is God, or glory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. For this cauſe it is, that they remain as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and obſtinate in their fading pleaſures, as if they were immortal: the which was ſignified by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſo hard Mettals. But in <hi>David,</hi> who ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditated and framed a lively conception what the eternity of years was, it cauſed ſo great a fear, and ſo awaked his ſpirits with care and diligence, that it produced in him an extraordinary change of life: in ſo much as he ſaid with great reſolution within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Now I begin. This is a change from the right hand of the moſt high.</hi>

I will henceforth ſeriouſly take to heart with a new purpoſe, a new fervour, and a a more vehement endeavour the paths of a better life, and entring the way of ſpiritual profit begin every day afreſh.</q> And becauſe he knew his heart to be ſo much changed, he confeſſed his reſolution to be miraculous, ſaying, <hi>This change is from the hand of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51068:14"/>moſt high;</hi> as if he had ſaid, according to the ſame <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius,</hi> to have in this ſort changed me out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ignorance into the ſplendor of wiſdom, from vices unto vertues, from a carnal man unto a ſpiritual, is onely to be attributed to the ayd, and moſt merciful aſſiſtance of God, who by the knowledge of Eternity hath given ſo notable a converſion unto my heart. This great thought of Eternity doth mightily enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the underſtanding, and gives us a true and perfect knowledge of things as they are. For this cauſe in ſome of the Pſalms which <hi>David</hi> made with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as we have already ſaid, he added this word <hi>underſtanding,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6.</note> or <hi>for the underſtanding,</hi> that is, to give underſtanding to thoſe, who meditate upon the end of this life, and the eternity of the other, and therefore deſpiſe the goods of the world.</p>
                  <p>By the experience of what happened unto his own ſoul the Prophet exhorts all men, that they meditate with quietneſs and leaſure upon the eternity of the two ſo oppoſite conditions which hereafter expect them, that they may not only run, but flie unto with profit, and ſuffer with patience all the difficulty, which attend upon vertue: and therefore with great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſes on the part of God unto thoſe, who ſhall ſleep between the two lots, that is, unto thoſe, who in the quietneſs of prayer ſhall meditate upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of glory, and of hell, that there ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them the ſilver wings of the Dove, and her ſhoulders of gold, becauſe the ſpiritual life conſiſts not onely in the actions of our own good works, but alſo in the patient ſuffering the evil works of others; in lifting up our ſelves from the durt of this earth, and and flying towards Heaven, by performance of the Heroical and precious acts of vertue, and not yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the troubles and afflictions of this life which oppreſs us. All which is by a lively conception of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity effected with great merit and perfection; and for this reaſon did the Prophet expreſs it by the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51068:14"/>of thoſe things which men eſteem the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as of gold and ſilver. But becauſe to ſuffer is commonly more difficult then to do, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more meritorious, although both be very precious, for this cauſe he ſaid that the ſhoulders ſhould be of gold, and the wings of ſilver. This alſo did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Jacob</hi> hold for ſo ſingular a good, that he gave it unto his ſon <hi>Iſachar</hi> for a bleſſing, telling him that he ſhould lye down betwixt the two borders, that is, that he ſhould at leaſure meditate upon the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of happineſs or miſery eternal. For this reaſon he calleth him a ſtrong beaſt, as having the ſtrength of mind to overcome the difficulty of vertue, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the troubles and burdens of this life, to ſuffer the ſcorns and diſgraces of the world, to undergo great penances and mortifications, by conſidering the two eternal extreams which attend us.</p>
                  <p>And not onely amongſt Saints, but amongſt the Philoſophers, did the quiet and calm conſideration of Eternity produce a great love and deſire of things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and as great contempt of all which was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, even without looking upon thoſe two ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent extreams, which Chriſtian Religion propoſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. <hi>Seneca</hi> complained much, that he was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the meditation of Eternity, into which he was wholly abſorpt, his ſenſes ſuſpended and tied up as it were in a ſweet ſleep, by the content which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that conſideration.<note place="margin">Seneca Epiſt. <hi>22.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ANd therefore it ſhall much import us to frame a lively conception of Eternity, and having once framed it, to retain it in continual memory, which of it ſelf is more efficacious then that of Death; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both the one and the other be very profitable, yet that of Eternity is far more generous, ſtrong, and fruitful of good works: for by it did Virgins pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their purity, Anchorits perform their auſtere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Martyrs ſuffered their torments, the which were not comforted and encouraged in their pains by the fear of death, but by the holy reverence and hope of Eternity, and the love of God. It is true the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who hoped not for the immortality of the other life as we do, yet with the memory of death retired themſelves from the vanity of the world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed its greatneſs, compoſed their actions, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their lives according to the rules of reaſon and vertue.<note place="margin">Epict. c. <hi>28.</hi> apud S.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51068:15"/>that in the way of this life we ſhould alwayes have the end of it diſcovered, which is death, and the end of all things. But Chriſtians who believe the other life, are to add unto this contemplation of death the memory of Eternity; the advantages whereof are as far above it, as things eternal above thoſe which are temporal. The Philoſophers were ſo much moved with the apprehenſion of death, becauſe with it all things of this mortal life were to end, death being the limit whereunto they might enjoy their riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and delights, and no further; others deſired to die, becauſe their evils and afflictions were to die with them. If then death amaze ſome only becauſe it deprives them of the goods of this life, which by a thouſand other wayes uſe to fail, and which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even before the death of the owner are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, dangerous, and full of cares: and if others hope for death onely becauſe it frees them from the evils of life, which in themſelves are ſhort and little, as all things temporal are, why ſhould not we be moved by the thought of Eternity, which ſecures us goods great and everlaſting, and threatens us with evils ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and without end? Without doubt then if we rightly conceive of Eternity, the memory of it is much more powerful, then that of death: and if of this wiſe men have had ſo great an eſteem, and adviſed others to have the ſame, much more ought to be had of that of Eternity. <hi>Zenon</hi> deſirous to know an efficacious means how to compoſe his life, bridle his carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and obſerve the lawes of vertue, had recourſe unto the Oracle; which remitted him unto the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of death: ſaying, Go to the dead; conſult with them, and there thou ſhalt learn what thou demandeſt: There ſeeing the dead poſſeſs nothing of what they had, and that with their lives they had breathed out all their felicity, he might learn not to be puffed up with pride, nor to value the vanities of the world. For the ſame cauſe ſome Philoſophers did uſe to drink in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51068:16"/>the skulls of dead men, that they might keep in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual memory that they were to die, and were not to enjoy the pleaſures of this life, although neceſſary, unleſs alloid by ſome ſuch ſad remembrance. In like manner many great Monarchs uſed it as an Antidote againſt the blandiſhments of fortune, that their lives might not be corrupted by their too great proſperity. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> commanded a Page to tell him three times every morning; <hi>Philip thou art a man,</hi> putting him in mind that he was to die, and leave all. The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, four years before he died, commanded his Coffin to be made, which he carried along with him whither ſoever he went, which with a mute voice might tell him as much; <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian thou art to die, and leave all.</hi> The Emperors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Eaſt, amongſt other Enſignes of Majeſty, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their left hand a book with leaves of gold, which they called <hi>Innocency,</hi> the which was full of earth and duſt, in ſignification of humane mortality, and to put them in minde hereby of that ancient doom of Mankind, <hi>duſt thou art, and into duſt thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> And not without much conveniency was this memorial of death in the form of a book, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more inſtruction and learning, then the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of death, being the onely School of that great truth, where we may beſt learn to undeceive our ſelves. With reaſon alſo was the book called <hi>Innocency.</hi> For who will dare to ſin, that knows he is to die?

Finally, all Philoſophers agreed in this, that all their Philoſophy was the meditation of death.</p>
                  <p>But without doubt the contemplation of Eternity is far beyond all Philoſophy: it is a greater matter and of far more aſtoniſhment for the torments of Hell to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51068:16"/>laſt for ever; then for the greateſt Empires ſodainly to have an end: more horrible to ſuffer eternal evils, then to be deprived of temporal goods: greater mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that our ſouls are immortal, then that our bodies are to die. Wherefore Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe who aim to be perfect, are rather to endeavour in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſtrong conception of Eternity, then to ſtir up the fear of death, whoſe memory ought not to be needful for the contempt of what is temporal, ſince the firſt ſtep unto Chriſtian perfection (according to the Counſel of Chriſt) is to renounce all that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs of earth, that being ſo freed from thoſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian perfection, we may employ our ſelves in the conſideration and memory of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which expects us hereafter, as a reward of our holy works, and exerciſes of vertue. This horrid voice, <hi>Eternity, Eternity,</hi> is to ſound often in our hearts; Thou not onely art to die, but being dead, eternity attends thee. Remember there is a Hell without end, and fix it in thy memory, that there is a Glory for ever. This conſideration, That if thou ſhalt obſerve the Law of God, thou ſhalt be eternally rewarded, and if thou break it, thou ſhalt ſuffer pains without end, will be far more powerful with thee, then to know that the goods and evils of this life are to end in death. Be mindful therefore of Eternity, and reſound in the inmoſt part of thy ſoul, <hi>Eternity, Eternity.</hi> For this the Church when it conſecrates the Fathers of it, which are Biſhops, puts them in minde of this moſt powerful and efficacious memory of Eternity, bidding them think of eternal years, as <hi>David</hi> did. And in the aſſumption and conſecration of Popes they burn before their eyes a ſmall quantity of flax, with theſe words; <hi>Holy Father, ſo paſſes away the glory of the world,</hi> that by the ſight of that ſhort and tranſitory blaze, he may call to minde the flames eternal. And <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth for his impreſe and deviſe took a flaming fire, which in ſhort time burnt and conſumed a Popes Tiara, an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51068:17"/>Imperial Diadem, a Regal Crown, and a Cardinals Hat, to give them to underſtand, that if they complyed not with the duties of their places, they were in a ſhort time to burn in the eternal flames of hell; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof he would preſerve ever preſent by this moſt profitable Symbol.</p>

                        </note> which ſeriouſly conſiders it. The Amethyſt cauſe Vigilancy. And what requires it more, then the paſſage betwixt the two extreams of eternal glory, and eternal pains? What thing in the world ought to awake us more, then the danger of falling into hell fire? How could that man ſleep, which were to paſs over a narrow plank of half a foot broad, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a bridge betwixt two moſt high rocks, the windes impetuouſly blowing, and he, if his foot ſlipt, certain to fall into a moſt vaſt abyſs? No leſs is the danger of this life. The way by which we are to paſs unto Heaven is moſt ſtreight, the windes of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51068:17"/>violent, the dangers of occaſions frequent, the harms by ill examples infectious, and the deceits of wicked Counſellors very many. How then can a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſleep and be careleſs in ſo evident a peril? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt it is more difficult to be ſaved, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the depravedneſs of our nature, and the deceitful ambuſhes of the Devil, then for a heavy man to paſs over a heady and rapid river upon a ſmall and bruiſed reed.</p>
                     <p>They ſay alſo of the Amethyſt, that beſides the making him watchful who carries it, it frees him from evil thoughts; which how can that man have who bears Eternity in his mind? how can he think upon the ſhort pleaſures of his ſenſes, who conſiders the eternal torments due unto his ſoul, if he ſhall but conſent to the leaſt mortal ſin? The Amethyſt alſo reſiſts drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, preſerving him that wears it in his ſenſes and judgment; and there is nothing that more preſerves a mans judgment in the middeſt of the wine of delights in this life, then the memory of the other, and that for the pleaſure of one moment here he is not only to ſuffer for hours, for dayes, for moneths, for years, but for worlds, and a world of worlds hereafter. The Amethyſt beſides this preſerves the wearer from the force of poiſon. And what greater Antidote againſt the poiſon of ſin, then to remember Hell, which he deſervs, and Heaven, which he loſes by committing it? The Amethyſt alſo quiets a man, and ſettles his thoughts. And what can be more efficacious to free us from the diſturbance of this life, to bridle the inſolence of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, to repreſs the aſpiring of ambition, then to conſider the bleſſings of Eternity, which attend the humble and poor in ſpirit? Finally, the Amethyſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs fruitfulneſs; and this great thought of Eternity is fruitful of holy works. For who is he that conſiders with a lively faith, that for a thing ſo ſleight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary he may enjoy the reward of eternal glory, and will not be animated to work all he is able, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51068:18"/>to endure and ſuffer what ſhall happen for God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and his Cauſe? O how fruitful of Heroical works is this holy thought, <hi>Eternal glory expects me!</hi> the Triumphs of Martyrs, the Victories of Virgins, the Mortifications of Confeſſors are the effects of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. O holy thought! O precious Amethyſt, that makes vigilant and attentive the negligent and careleſs: that gives wiſdom and judgment to the moſt deceived: that heals thoſe, who are moſt ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and corrupted with the poiſon of ſin; that qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and pacifies the motions and troubles of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences; that makes the moſt tepid and barren of vertues fruitful of holy works; who will not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain and fix thee in his Soul? O that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would ſo grave thee in their heart, that thou mighteſt never be blotted out nor removed from thence. How differently would they then live to what they now do? how would they ſhine in their works? for although the memory of Hell, Heaven, Death, and Judgment be very efficacious for the reformation of our lives, yet this of Eternity is like the quinteſcence of them all, and virtually contains the reſt.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>BEfore we come to declare the conditions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whoſe conſideration is ſo neceſſary for the leading of a holy and a vertuous life, let us ſet before our eyes the forgetfulneſs and miſerable miſtakes of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in a matter of ſo great importance, living as if Eternity were far off, when as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſayes it is not two fingers diſtant, and every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute threatens them. What devides the Mariner from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51068:18"/>his death, but the thickneſs of a plank? What the cholerick and haſty man from Eternity, but the edge of a ſword? what the Souldier from his end, but the reach of a bullet? what the Theef from the Gallows, but the diſtance betwixt that and the Priſon? Finally, how far is the moſt healthful and vigorous perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Eternity, but as much as death is from life, which often happens ſodainly, and ought every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be expected? The life of Man is a dangerous paſſage, wherein he walks upon the brink of Eternity, with a certainty at laſt to fall into it. How lives he then ſo wretchedly? He who ſhould walk cloſe unto a great precipice in a path no broader then the breadth of his foot, and that alſo full of rubs and ſtumbling blocks, how circumſpectly would he look about him, and how carefully would he order his ſteps? how then is it, that being ſo near Eternity he is ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and lives as if he were out of danger?</p>

                     <note place="margin">In Hiſto. Barla. ca. <hi>12.</hi> in fine.</note>St. <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> excellently declares the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſtakes of men in a moſt ingenious Parable, wherein he naturally ſets forth the ſtate of this life. A certain man, ſaith he, flying from a furious Unicorn, which with his very roaring made the mountains tremble, and the valleys to reſound, not regarding through fear which way he went, chanced to fall into a molt deep pit; but in his fall ſpreading abroad his armes to catch at ſomething, which might relieve him, happened to light upon the boughs of a tree, which grew out of the ſide of that pit, whereon he ſeized with much joy, hoping he had then both eſcaped the fury of the beaſt, and the danger of his fall: but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the foot of the tree, he perceived two great Rats, the one white, the other black, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually gnawing the root of it, in ſo much, that it was now ready to fall; looking afterward into the bottom of the pit, he beheld a moſt deformed Dragon with flaming eyes gazing upon him, and with open mouth awaiting his fall, that he might devour him; then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51068:19"/>caſting his eyes unto that ſide of the pit where the tree grew, there appeared four poiſonful Aſpicks, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth their heads to bite him. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marking the leaves of the tree he might perceive ſome of them to diſtil certain drops of honey, with which he was ſo greatly pleaſed, that forgetting the dangers, which from ſo many parts threatned him, he employed himſelt wholly in gathering and taſting drop by drop that ſmall quantity of honey, without reflecting or making further account either of the fierceneſs of the Unicorn above him, of the horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Dragon beneath him, of the poiſon of the Aſpicks aſide him, or the weakneſs of the tree which was ready to fall, and precipitate him into that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Dungeon. In this Image we ſee repreſented the Eſtates of men, who forgetful of the perils of this tranſitory life, give themſelves wholly over unto vain pleaſures. By the Unicorn is ſignified death, which even from the hour of Man's birth follows and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues him; The Pit is the world full of evils and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; The Tree is the courſe of this life; The two Rats, the one black, the other white, which gnaw it at the root, are day and night, which continually ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another go by hours and minutes conſuming it; The four Aſpicks are the four Elements, or four Humours, of which we are compoſed, the which by the exceſs of any one of them diſtemper the whole frame of our bodies, and at laſt deſtroy it; That hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and fearfull Dragon is the eternity of Hell, which enlarges his throat and jawes to ſwallow ſinners; The ſmall drops of honey are the pleaſures and delights of this life; and ſo great is the diverſion which they cauſe, that men for a ſhort and momentary content conſider not the many dangers, unto which they are expoſed; and ſeeing themſelves encompaſſed on all parts by as many dangers of death, as there are wayes and cauſes of dying, which are infinite, and are ſo many mouths and gates of Eternity, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51068:19"/>ſolace themſelves with the momentary delights of this ſmall drop of honey, which ſhall at laſt cauſe them to diſgorge and caſt up their entrals for a world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                  <p>Wonderful it is, that ſo great a forgetfulneſs poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us, and a matter full of amazement, that we are not moved with ſo great dangers. How comes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that every minute a new day of Eternity dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us we careleſly paſs over ſo many dayes and moneths? Let the moſt ſtrong and healthful perſon tell me, what one year he is aſſured of, wherein death may not aſſault him, and puſh him headlong into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal abyſs. But what ſpeak I of a year? what moneth, what day, what hour, what inſtant is he ſure of? how then can he eat? how ſleep in ſafety? If one ſhould enter into a field full of ambuſhes and ſecret traps, whereon if he ſhould chance to ſet his careleſs foot, he were in danger to fall upon the points of Pikes or Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, or into the mouth of ſome terrible Dragon, and ſeeing with his own eyes, that they, who entred with him into the ſame field, hourly fell into thoſe traps, and appeared no more, ſhould notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run leaping and dancing up and down without fear or apprehenſion of any thing amiſs, who would not ſay that man were a fool? Certainly more fool art thou, who ſeeing thy friends fall daily into the trap of Death, thy neighbour ſwallowed up in Eternity, thy brother ſink into the pit of the Grave, doſt yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding remain careleſs and ſecure, as if the ſame fate did not attend thy ſelf. Although to die were a thing uncertain, yet for the doubt and danger, that it might happen, thou oughteſt to be vigilant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it. What oughteſt thou then to be, it being ſo certain, and that early or late thou art to enter in at the gate of Eternity? A marvelous thing it is with what care men provide themſelves againſt dangers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though very uncertain. If they hear that Theeves are in the way to rob and ſpoil the paſſengers, no man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51068:20"/>paſſes that way but armed, provided, and many in company: if they underſtand that the Plague begins to range, what antidotes and conterpeſts are ſought for? if they fear a Famine, every man in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides himſelf of corn. How happens it then, that knowing that there is a Death, a Judgment, a Hell, an Eternity, we ſtand not upon our guards, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our ſelves for it? Let us open our eyes and look into the perils which environ us; let us take heed where we ſet our feet, that we periſh not; for the paths of this life are full of dangers. And with reaſon did <hi>Iſidorus Clarius</hi> compare it to a narrow Bridge,<note place="margin">Iſid. Clar. &amp; juxt. S. Greg.</note> ſcarce broad enough to receive our feet, under which was a Lake of black and filthy water, full of ſerpents, and of ugly and poiſonous creatures, which onely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained themſelves by feeding on thoſe unfortunate people, who fell from the Bridge; on either ſide were pleaſant Gardens, Meadows, Fountains, and beautiful Buildings: But as it were extream madneſs in him, who was to paſs ſo dangerous a Bridge, to entertain himſelf with gazing upon thoſe Gardens and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without taking care where he ſet his foot: ſo is it as great a fully in him, who is to paſs this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life, to apply himſelf to pleaſures and delights without taking care of his wayes or works. To this <hi>Ceſarius Arelatenſis</hi> adds, That the greateſt danger of of this Bridge conſiſted towards the end, where it was narroweſt: and this is the moſt ſtreight paſſage of Death. Let us therefore, if we intend to gain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, look how we place our feet in this life, leaſt we miſplace them in death, and periſh in that Eternity, wherein our life is to conclude. O Eternity, Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how few there are that provide for thee? O E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, peril of perils, and (if we miſs the mark, whereat we ought to aim) above all dangers, whence comes it that we prepare not for thee? whence comes it that we fear thee not, which art to endure as long as God is God? this preſent life is but to laſt a very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51068:20"/>little time, our forces will fail us, our ſenſes wax dull, our riches leave us, the commodities of the world fly from us, the want of breath make an end of us, and the world at laſt call us out of it; what then will become of us? we are to be ſent into a ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for a long time: why do we not forecaſt what to do when we come thither?</p>
                  <p>But that we may the better ſee this our condition, and ſo learn to be more cautious, I will relate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parable of the ſame St. <hi>John Damaſcen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In vita Joſaph.</note> There was, ſaith he, a City very great and populous, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Inhabitants had a Cuſtom to elect for their King a ſtranger, who had no knowledge of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Common-wealth: This King for a year they ſuffered to do what he liſt, but that being ended, and he moſt ſecure without fear, or apprehenſion of any thing amiſs, thinking he ſhould raign as long as live, they ſuddainly came upon him, deſpoiled him of his royal apparel, dragging him naked through the ſtreets, and baniſhing him into an Iſland far off, where he came to ſuffer extream poverty, not having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to feed or cloth himſelf, his fortune without thinking on it wholly changing into the contrary, his riches into poverty, his joy into ſadneſs, his dainties into hunger, and his royal purple into nakedneſs. But once it happened, that he whom they elected was a prudent and a ſubtil man, and having underſtood from one of his Counſellors this evil and wicked Cuſtom of the Citizens and their notable inconſtancy, grew not proud, and haughty with the Dignity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they had conferred upon him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came careful in providing for himſelf, that when he ſhould be depoſed and baniſhed into that Iſland, which he every moment expected, he might not as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours periſh with poverty and hunger. The courſe he took was during his Reign to tranſport ſecretly into that Iſland all the Treaſures of the City, which were very great. The year being ended, the Citizens,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51068:21"/>according to their Cuſtome with his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, came in an uproar to depoſe him of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Royalty, and to ſend him in exile into the Iſland; whither he went without trouble, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand provided wherewith he might live in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and plenty, whilſt the preceding Kings periſh'd with want and penury. This is that which paſſes in this world, and the courſe which a wiſe man ought to take. That City ſignifies this world, fooliſh, vain, and moſt inconſtant, wherein when we think to reign, we are ſuddenly deſpoiled of all we have, and ſent naked into our Graves, when we leaſt look for it, and are moſt buſie in enjoying and entertaining our ſelves with the fading and tranſitory pleaſures of this life, as if we were immortal, without ſo much as thinking on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, whither we are in a ſhort time to be baniſht: A Region far off and far removed from our thoughts, whither we are to go naked, and forſaken of all, where we are to periſh with an eternal death, and ſhall only live to be tormented: into a Land of the dead, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and dark, where no light enters, but everlaſting horrour and eternal ſorrow inhabits. He is therefore wiſe, who foreſeeing that he is to be deſpoiled of all he hath in this world, provides for the next, making ſuch uſe of time in this life, that he may finde the profit of it in Eternity, and with the holy works of pennance, charity, and alms tranſports his Treaſures into that Region, where he is to dwell for ever. Let us therefore think upon the Eternal, and for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Temporal, and we ſhall gain both the one, and the other. The conſideration of Eternity St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> underſtood to be figured by the Store-houſe well furniſhed with precious wine, into which the Spouſe ſaith that the Bridegroom brought her, and in her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Charity; becauſe, ſaith he, he who ſhall with a profound attention conſider in his mind Eternity, may glory in himſelf, ſaying, <hi>he hath ordained in me charity;</hi> by which thought he ſhall better preſerve

                  <p>LEt us therefore begin to declare ſomething of what is inexplicable, and to frame ſome kind of conception of what is incomprehenſible, whereby Chriſtians knowing, or (to ſpeak more properly) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs ignorant of what is Eternity, they may have a horrour either to commit a ſin, or to omit an act of vertue; trembling in themſelves, that for matters of ſo ſmall value, as are thoſe of the Earth, they are to loſe things ſo great and precious, as are thoſe of Heaven. <hi>Agrippina</hi> perceiving the great laviſhneſs of her Son, who poured out gold and ſilver, as if it had been wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſirous to reform his prodigality, upon a time when the Emperour had commanded about a quarter of a Million to be beſtowed upon ſome Minion of his, cauſed that Money, and as much more to be ſpread upon a Table, and placed where he was to paſs, to the end, that ſeeing with his own eyes the mighty maſs of Treaſure, which he ſo waſtfully miſpent, he might after with more diſcretion moderate his vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Truly, the folly and vanity of Man admits no other cure, than to ſet before his eyes, that for the ſmall and momentary pleaſure of a ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God, he loſes and unthriftily caſts away that which is to laſt for ever. For this cauſe we ought to conſider, what it is to have no end, what it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51068:22"/>is to laſt for ever, what it is to be Eternal. But who is able to declare this, ſince Eternity is an immenſe Ocean, whoſe bottom cannot be found: a moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure abyſs, wherein are ſunk all the faculties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding: an intricate Labyrinth, out of which there is no iſſue: a perpetual Preſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out what was, or what ſhall be: a continued Circle, whoſe Centre is in every part, and Circumference no where: a great Year, which ever begins, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ended: finally, that which never can be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, yet ever ought to be pondered, and thought upon. But that we may ſay ſomething, and frame ſome conception of it, let us ſee in what manner the Saints have defined it. St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> knows not what it is, but only what it is not; and therefore ſays, <hi>Eternity is not time, nor part of time;</hi> becauſe time, and each part of time paſs away, but in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nothing does nor ever ſhall paſs. All the torments, with which a Soul enters into hell, ſhall after millions of years paſt torment him as lively, and entirely as at the firſt beginning; neither ſhall the joyes, with which the juſt enter into Heaven, ever in the leaſt ſort dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. Time hath this property to draw along with it cuſtome, which at length leſſens the ſenſe of what at firſt was grievous; but Eternity is ever the ſame, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entire, in it nothing paſſes, the pains, with which the damned begin, ſhall after a thouſand ages be the ſame they were at firſt; and the glory, which he who is ſaved receives in the firſt inſtant, ſhall ever appear freſh and new unto him. Eternity hath no parts; all is of a piece; in it there is no diminution, nor leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And although the pleaſures of this life, which go along with time, are of this condition, that in time they leſſen, and that there is no delight in this world, which by long enjoying becomes not troubleſome and tedious: and that to the contrary, even griefs and and pains with continuance either grow leſs, or are abſolutely cured; yet far otherwiſe is the web which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51068:22"/>Eternity weaves: it is all uniform; in it there is no joy which wearies us, nor any pain which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance abates, or becomes leſs ſenſible; in ſo much as Eternity, according to St. <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>10.</hi> de divin. nomin.</note> is the immutability, immortality, and incorruptibility of a thing wholly and altogether exiſtent; a ſpace which periſhes not, but is always ſubſiſtent after the ſame manner; and therefore, as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the tree falls, there it ſhall for ever remain:</hi> if thou ſhalt fall as an infernal fire-brand into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell, there ſhalt thou be for ever burning whileſt God is God; it not being in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to redeem thee thence, nor in thy own ſo much as to turn from one ſide to the other.</p>
                  <p>Eternity is immutable, becauſe incompatible with change: it is immortal, becauſe not capable of end: and incorruptible, becauſe it cannot ſuffer diminution. The evils of this life, how deſperate of remedy ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet want not this comfort, that they are either eaſed with change, or ended by death, or leſſened by corruption. But all this is wanting in eternal evils. The change of pains ſerves for a refreſhment, and the infirm man, how afflicted ſoever, by turning from ſide to ſide receives ſome eaſe; but eternal pains ſhall whilſt God is God remain in the ſame poſture, force, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour without change at all. If the moſt pleaſant and wholeſome food of Manna, only becauſe continual, cauſed vomiting, and became loathſome; What ſhall thoſe pains, which ſhall laſt for ever? What torments ſhall they cauſe, ſince they are to remain ſtill after the ſame manner? The Sea hath his ebbs and flows, the Rivers their encreaſes, the Planets their various Aſpects, the Year his four Seaſons, the greateſt Feavers have their relaxations, and the ſharpeſt pain arriving at the height uſes to decreaſe; only eternal torments ſhall never ſuffer declination; nor ſhall the eyes of the damned ever ſee a change. The plain and even way, which ſeems moſt eaſie, wearies the Traveller, becauſe it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51068:23"/>wants variety. What wearineſs ſhall then the ways of Eternity cauſe, and thoſe perpetual pains, which can neither change, end, nor diminiſh? The torments, whereunto <hi>Cain</hi> entred now five thouſand years ago, are after ſo many ages paſt ſtill the ſame they were at firſt; and what they now are, ſhall be ſo many ages more to come; they are meaſured by the Eternity of God, and the duration of his unhappineſs by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Divine Glory; whilſt God lives he ſhall wraſtle with death, and ſhall immortally continue dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that eternal death ſtill living, and that miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life ſtill dying, containing the worſt of life, and the worſt of death: thoſe wretched Souls living only, that they may ſuffer torments, and dying, that they may not enjoy comfort, having neither the content of life, nor the end of death; but contrariwiſe for their greater torment have the pain of death, and duration of life. On the other part behold the happy lot of them that die in Grace: their glory ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal without fear of ending; their happineſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable without capacity of growing old; their Crown incorruptible without danger of withering: where no day ſhall paſs without joy, whoſe content ſhall be ever new, and whoſe Glory flouriſh for perpetual Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and whoſe happineſs ſhall ever be the ſame. And that very Glory, which St. <hi>Michael</hi> was ſix thouſand years ago poſſeſt of, the ſame he enjoys this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as freſh and new, as the firſt day, and ſhall ſix millions of years to come as new, as now.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LEt us now hear the Opinions of <hi>Severinus Boëtius</hi> and <hi>Plotinus</hi> two great Philoſophers, and the one of them no leſs a Divine, what they conceive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this great Myſtery and ſecret of Eternity. <hi>Boë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> defines Eternity to be,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de conſ. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho.</note> 
                     <hi>A total and perfect poſſeſſion of an indeterminable life:</hi> which Definition, although it principally belongs unto the Eternity of God, yet it may-be alſo applied unto the Eternity of reaſonable Creatures: ſince they alſo enjoy a total and perfect poſſeſſion of happineſs in an eternal life, never to end. With reaſon he calls it a poſſeſſion, for the fulneſs it hath of joy; poſſeſſion being the beſt way of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the which implies a ful Dominion of what it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes: for he who hath a thing in loan or truſt, may be ſaid to enjoy it, but not with that liberty, as he who poſſeſſes it. He ſays moreover, that this poſſeſſion is total, becauſe it is of all goods and bleſſings, without miſſing of any one, and all of them at once, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary for the enjoying of them, to have them one after another, but altogether. The goods and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life have not this condition; for although one were Maſter of them all, yet he could not enjoy them all at once, but ſucceſſively; ſome paſſing away, and others ſucceeding in their place. The Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who moſt deſired, and moſt endeavoured to enjoy them, for all the diligence and haſte he uſed, was hardly poſſeſt of three or four at once: for whilſt he was in his Banquets, he could not attend his Maſques and Dances; whilſt he was in theſe, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not the pleaſures of the Shews, and Spectacles
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51068:24"/>of the Amphitheater; whilſt he was preſent at them, he could not apply himſelf to Hunting, and Sports of the field; and whilſt ſo imployed, he could not ſatiate himſelf in Luſt and Senſuality: Finally, to enjoy one, he muſt of neceſſity quit the other; inſomuch as he could neither enjoy all pleaſures, thoſe wanting which were enjoyed by others: and of thoſe, which he might enjoy himſelf, but few at a time. But unto the juſt in Heaven no bleſſings or contents are miſſing, no ſucceſſion needful for their enjoying, the bleſſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them all, and all together.</p>
                  <p>The poſſeſſion of this happineſs is alſo perfect in reſpect of the ſecurity it hath, nothing being of force to diſquiet it, none to go to Law about it, none to ſteal it, none to diſturb it, and is likewiſe perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe compleat; not like the goods of the earth, which cannot be enjoyed entirely: for either the diſtance of place, the imperfection of the ſenſible Organ, the mixture of ſome grief or care, or at leaſt the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Objects, and their own oppoſition diſtract the perfect fruition of them. But eternal happineſs is by the bleſſed in its full extenſion perfectly poſſeſt, the joy of it entirely reliſht, and the eſſence and ſweetneſs of it wholly penetrated, and imbibed into the eſſence of the Soul, the which no mixture of pain, no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of grief, no incapacity of the ſubject, no diſtance of poſition, no greatneſs of the object can hinder: for grief and care have there no place, the ſubject is elevated above its nature, the object accommodated, and the eternal pleaſure and delight of it not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by ſpace and diſtance.<note place="margin">

                     </gap> life in man which ſhall not be full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy, and content. The life of the hearing ſhall be full with the conſort of moſt harmonious muſick;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51068:24"/>the life of the ſmell ſhall be full with the fragrancies of moſt ſweet odours; the life of the eyes ſhall be full, feeding themſelves with all beauty; the life of the underſtanding ſhall be full with the knowledge of the Creator; and the life of the will ſhall be full in loving, rejoycing, and delighting it ſelf in him. Temporal life is not capable of this fulneſs and ſatisfaction even in ſmall matters, the attention of one ſenſe hinders that of another, and the attention of the body that of the ſpirit. This life cannot be here enjoyed but by parts, and that alſo not compleatly: but in that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity the life ſhall be full, the poſſeſſion total, and the joy perfect, where all is to live which here can die, where neither the incompoſſibility of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor the impediment of the ſenſes, nor the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the ſoul ſhall hinder us from enjoying all bleſſings together with all our ſenſes, and all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers joyntly. Over and above all this poſſeſſion, which is ſo total, ſo perfect, and ſo full, is for life without death, a ſpace without limit, a day eternal, which is equivalent to all dayes, and includes all years, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all ages, and excels all times, becauſe in it nothing paſſes, nor any good of it ever ſhall paſs.</p>
                  <p>To the contrary it is with thoſe wretched ſinners, whoſe eternal miſeries have the ſame condition of bad, which the eternity of the bleſſed hath of good: unto whom their evill ſhall not be extrinſecal, but in full poſſeſſion of them, and they ſhall remain in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all their ſoul, body, powers, and ſenſes. That is called poſſeſſion, which is acquired by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and real preſence. Theſe then unfortunate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are to continue in their torments with all what they have of being, not as in a thing lent or diſtant from them, but as in a thing ſo proper, as it can by no poſſibility be parted or ſeparated from them, nothing being more proper and due, then puniſhment is to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Wherefore all evils ſhall take poſſeſſion of all what they are, their ſenſes, their members, the joynts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51068:25"/>of their bodies, the powers of their ſoul, their moſt ſpiritual faculties ſhall be poſſeſſed by fire, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, grief, rage, deſpite, miſerie, and malediction. This poſſeſſion of thoſe unfortunate creatures ſhall be total, becauſe of all evils: for no evil can be wanting where there is a concourſe and meeting of all torments and unhappineſs. In the taſte there ſhall not want bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the appetite hunger, in the tongue thirſt, in the ſight horrour, in the hearing aſtoniſhment, in the ſmell ſtink, in the heart pain, in the imagination fear, in every member grief, and in the very bowels fire.</p>
                  <p>All evils are therefore to poſſeſs the damned, and all totally; their torments being ſo many, that if they were to ſuffer them one after another, many years would not ſuffice to finiſh them. And this only were ſufficient to make their condition moſt terrible. But above all their unhappineſs this is the greateſt, that they are to ſuffer them all at once. The pain in one part of the body is not to hope it ſhould ceaſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the grief of the ſpirit is not to expect that the fire which burns the fleſh ſhould have an end; all evils are to ſet upon them at once, and all at one clap are to fall upon the heads of the damned. The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one little drop hollows a Stone: and to ruine the world it was enough for God to rain for forty dayes. What ſhall then be, when his divine juſtice ſhall rain fire, ſulphur, and tempeſt upon the heads of the damned, not for forty dayes, but whilſt God is God? Beſides all this they ſhall not only be poſſeſt by all the the evils, and all joyntly at once, but by all of them fully in their whole force and vigour. The ſenſe of them ſhall not grow leſs by their multitude, nor dull by their greatneſs, but ſhall remain as quick and lively to them all, and ſhall be as ſenſible of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of each one of them, as if they ſuffered but one onely: for the fire ſhall not onely penetrate their bones, heart, and entrals, but the fury of it ſhall ſearch into the very ſoul, and burn that with immortal flames.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51068:25"/>The poſſeſſion of its miſery ſhall be Whole, it ſhall be Perfect, it ſhall be Full; Whole, becauſe it ſhall ſuffer all ſort of evils; Perfect, becauſe it ſhall ſuffer them wholly; and Full, becauſe it ſhall ſuffer in all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in all the faculties that are capable of ſuffering. This eſtate and life, where we now are, is not to laſt, or, to ſpeak more properly, this death is not to live; but in the damned, their death ſhall live as long as God ſhall have life, and their miſeries ſhall endure as long as God ſhall have glory.</p>

                  <p>ST. <hi>Bernard</hi> in another manner deſcribes Eternity, ſaying, <hi>It is that which embraces all times, paſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. <hi>1.</hi> in feſto Omn. Sancto.</note> 
                     <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come:</hi> becauſe no dayes, no years, no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are able to fill up Eternity: it is that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſible and imaginable, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with a ſtomach unburthen'd, ſtill greedy of ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing more: It is ſaid to embrace all time, becauſe it enjoyes all that in an inſtant which is to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all time. Wherefore <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> called E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity <hi>an eternal moment:</hi> and <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſaid, <hi>it was both the longeſt and ſhorteſt of all things.</hi> It was longeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it exceeded all time, and laſted infinite ſpaces; it was ſhorteſt, becauſe it contained all that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which it was capable of containing in an infinite duration. For as time is a fluid inſtant, which flies and paſſes away, inſomuch as there is nothing of time in being but the preſent, which is ever running and changing from one moment to another; ſo Eternity is a permanent inſtant, fixt and ſtable, in which all things remain at once, and are ever exiſtent in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51068:26"/>ſame manner and eſtate: Before it all times paſs, the one ſucceeding the other, whileſt it ſtands preſent and perſeveres the ſame unto them all. Time and things temporal are like a Rapid river, wherein the waves run rowling down, each ſucceeding other in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual viciſſitude: But Eternity is like a firm rock, or like the bed of that river, which remains ſettled and conſtant in the ſame place, whileſt the waters paſs thorow it never to appear again. In the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner things temporal, without permancy or conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at all, paſs haſtily in the preſence of Eternity, and never more return to ſalute the world. And as the Bed of the river, though ſtanding ſtill, contains all the waters which run thorow it, ſo Eternity embraces all times which paſſes by it. Eternity may alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto the Centre in a Circle, which being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly one correſponds unto the whole circumference, and equally reſpects each particular point contained in it. In the ſame manner Eternity correſponds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all time, and to each inſtant of it after a moſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous way, containing all that in preſent, which time contains ſucceſſively in a million of ages, and is an inſtant equivalent unto an infinity of times, not having one part after another, but the whole extenſion amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in one inſtant, containing all that together in one moment, which is extenſible unto infinite diſtances of time. For as the immenſity of God contains in one point all the Divine greatneſs, which without bound or limit is dilated over all parts real and imaginable, in ſo much as it contains in one point, as much as in a million of leagues: even ſo Eternity recollects into one inſtant all the Divine duration, although extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through an infinite time; which alſo the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures are to participate in the other life for as much as concerns their glory or pain, and after ſuch a manner as they are capable of.</p>
                  <p>Whence follows one thing very much to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that thoſe goods unto which Eternity is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:51068:26"/>it makes infinitely better, and that after two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and, as we may ſay, with two infinities; and contrariwiſe the bad it makes infinitely worſe, and that alſo after the ſame two manners; The firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the duration which it conferrs, the which is infinite: and every thing is to be eſteemed ſo much the greater, by how much the duration is longer. The content of a day is not ſo great as that of a week, nor is that equal to the content of a moneth or year; and as the duration encreaſes, ſo the value of the pleaſure grows higher, in ſo much as if it laſt infinitely, it is infinitely to be eſteemed. In the like manner of pain, the longer it laſts the worſe it is, and if it laſt infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it becomes an infinite evil, which will infinitely exceed any temporal evil whatſoever, though more in greatneſs: and that in ſo high a degree, that if it ſhould be left to ones choice, either to be thrown alive into a burning Furnace, and at the ſame time to ſuffer all the infirmities and griefs which Phyſick knows, and all the kindes of torments which Martyrs have endured, and all the cruel puniſhments which have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the moſt hainous Offender, and all this for the ſpace of 200 millions of years, but then to end and paſs no further: or to ſuffer a Migram, or a Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach for a whole eternity, certainly he ought rather to chooſe all thoſe torments together for that time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then either of theſe ſingle pains for ever; becauſe although thoſe exceed this in greatneſs, yet this would infinitely exceed thoſe in duration. In ſumme, if thoſe, although exceſſive, were temporal, and this, though leſs, were eternal, which would infinitely encreaſe the malice of it, there being hopes that thoſe would at laſt find an end, but this were without remedy: I dare be bold to think, that the lively apprehenſion of Eternity, which the damned conceive, is ſuch, that if it were in ones election either to be exempted from all the torments he now endures, and to remain affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted only with the Stone for an eternity; or to have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51068:27"/>added unto his own particular torments all thoſe which the reſt of the damned ſuffer in all their ſenſes, but limited for a thouſand millions of years, he would chooſe this laſt for the leſſer evil; at leaſt in reaſon he ought to chooſe it: for although thoſe pains were greater, yet they were to have an end, and this of the Stone, though leſs, was to be eternal.</p>
                  <p>Let now thoſe levers and eſteemers of tranſitory pleaſures come to a reckoning with themſelves. If the torments of hell, though ſo exceſſive, were ſufferable if they were only temporal, nay to be choſen rather, then ſo ſleight a grief, as the Stone, that were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, how happens it, that they will not ſuffer with patience one ſmall grief during the ſhort time of this life in exchange of being freed from the eternal pains of hell fire during the other? If a Giant in time (that we may ſo ſpeak) hath no bulk or appearance in the preſence of a Pigmey in eternity, how comes it then that a Dwarf or Pigmey in time affrights us, and an armed Giant in eternity makes us not tremble? how is it that eternal hell moves us not, and yet we fear a temporal pain? how is it we do not penance for our ſins? why have we not patience in our afflictions? why ſuffer we not all that which can be ſuffered in this life rather than to ſuffer one onely torment in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? The pains of this valley of tears, being they are to have an end, are not to be feared in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe which ſhall never have it: how content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly then ought we to ſuffer here a little, and for a ſhort time, that we may be freed from ſuffering much hereafter, and for ever?</p>
                  <p>What we have conſidered in evils and afflictions, the ſame is to be conſidered in goods and bleſſings. If one were to enjoy all the pleaſures of the ſenſes for a thouſand miriads of years, but were to paſs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ought to change them all for one onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that would laſt for ever. Why then exchange we not one periſhing pleaſure of the earth, which is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51068:27"/>to laſt but for a moment, for all thoſe immenſe joyes, which we are to poſſeſs in Heaven for a world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end? All the temporal goods of the world might well be quitted for the ſecuring of only one that were eternal; how is it then that we ſecure not all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal by forbearing now and then one which is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral? It would infinitely exceed the Dominion of the whole world, ſo long as the world ſhall laſt, to be Lord but of one little Cottage for eternity: time holds no compariſon with it, all that is temporal how great ſoever, being to be eſteemed vile and baſe, and all that is eternal, how ſmall ſoever, high and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that we may exaggerate this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as much as poſſible, the very being of God himſelf if it were but for a time, might be quitted for ſome other infinitely leſs excellent, which were eternal. And ſhall then the covetous man ſatisfie himſelf with thoſe poor treaſures, which death may quit him of to morrow, and perhaps the Theef to day, deſpiſing for them the eternal treaſure of Heaven? For certain if God ſhould promiſe as to enjoy the pleaſure of one onely ſenſe for ever in the next life, we ought for it to part with all the pleaſures we have in this: how huge a folly is it then, that promiſing all thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe joyes of Heaven, we will not for all them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether part with ſome of thoſe poor ones on earth?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way, by which Eternity, unto whatſoever it is joyned, makes the good infinitely better, and the bad infinitely worſe, is becauſe it collects it ſelf wholly into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inſtant, ſo that in every inſtant it makes us ſenſible of all that, which it is to contain in its whole duration: and being to endure for an infinity, it amaſſes as it were into every inſtant a whole infinity of pleaſure or pain, every inſtant being ſenſible both of what it contains at preſent, what is paſt, and what it ſhall contain in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; So, as a Doctor ſayes,<note place="margin">Leſ. de perfec. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>In Eternity all the good a thing can contain ſucceſſively in an infinite time, is recollected into one inſtant, and made perceptible
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51068:28"/>and enjoyable all at once. As if all the pleaſures a moſt delicious Banquet could afford ſucceſſively by parts, and that in an infinite time, ſhould be reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all at once, and all that delight ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred joyntly and together for eternity, certainly this would make it infinitely better, and of more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.</q> The ſame thing Eternity cauſes in evils and pains, recollecting them in a certain manner into one, and making them ſenſible all at once; and although they be not all really and actually together, yet it cauſes them to be apprehended altogether, and ſo produces in the Soul a grief infinite and without limit. Thoſe then are truly evils, which are totally and every way evils, both in extenſion, their duration having no end, and in intenſion, their being and eſſence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no limit or meaſure. What afflicted perſon who conſiders this can be impatient, ſince all the griefs of this life have both an end and limit? The greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral evils are but as biting of gnats in reſpect of the leaſt of thoſe which are eternal: and therefore that we may eſcape all the eternal, it is not much to ſuffer one temporal. Let us tremble at the conſideration of thoſe two lances of Eternity, thoſe two infinities, whoſe wounds are mortal, and pierce the damned from ſide to ſide: thoſe two unſupportable rocks, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm and cruſh whom they fall upon into pieces. All that we ſuffer here is to be laughed at, a fillip with a finger, a trifle in reſpect of the eternal, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces all times, and with the evils of them all falls every inſtant upon the head of the damned.</p>

                     <p>Beſides what hath been already ſaid, Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils eternal have this condition, that they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified and augmented by the future, but alſo by what is paſt, although temporal; ſo as the bleſſed Souls in Heaven not only enjoy the glory, which they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51068:28"/>have in preſent, and that which is to come, but alſo what is paſt even unto thoſe real and true goods of this life, to wit their vertues and good works, with the memory of which they recreate, and congratulate themſelves for all eternity: in ſo much as all goods paſt, preſent, and to come concur in one to fill up the meaſure of their joy, and the goods of all times even of thoſe of this life are amaſſed, and heaped up in their felicity. How different from this are temporal goods, ſince even thoſe, which we poſſeſs in preſent, ſuffer not themſelves to be entirely enjoyed? here is no good which is not alloyed by ſome want, danger, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And if for the preſent they afford ſo little content, much leſs do they for the future, ſince the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of what we poſſeſs is ſo uncertain, that the fear of loſing it often diſſeaſons the preſent guſt. The ſame fear alſo robbs our remembrance of the comfort of what is paſt, ſince we fear to loſe that moſt, which we have formerly taken moſt pleaſure in enjoying.</p>
                     <p>On all ſides then the eternal goods are much more excellent, unto which we ought to aſpire, and ſtrive to purchaſe them even at the coſt of all which is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and in this life as much as may be to imitate the ſame eternity; the which is to be done by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe three Vertues, which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us in theſe words.<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>1.</hi> in Feſto Om. Sact.</note> 
                        <q>With Poverty of ſpirit, with Meekneſs, and Contrition of heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Soul a ſimilitude and image of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity which embraces all times. For with pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpirit we merit the future; with meekneſs we poſſeſs the preſent, and with the tears of repentance recover what is paſt.</q> And truely he, who eſteems Eternity, hath no more than to exerciſe himſelf in the practiſe of thoſe three Vertues: The firſt by quitting with ſpiritual poverty all that is temporal, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it for the eternal, not ſetting his heart upon any thing in this life, that he may find it bettered in the other. For as Eternity does infinitely augment that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51068:29"/>good or evil, unto which it is annexed, ſo time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes and draws violently after it all that is in it. Things therefore which are to finiſh, require not much to leave them, and thoſe that are to end in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, are to be reputed for nothing. For the ſecond Vertue, a Chriſtian ought with patience and meekneſs to perſiſt in doing well, and in overcoming the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of vertue, ſince the ſlight troubles of this life are to be rewarded with eternal happineſs in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And who ſeeing hell open, and the abyſs of its evils without bottom, would not bear with patience the rigour of penance, and with meekneſs ſuffer the impertinency of an injury, not troubling at all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior peace of his Soul, but attending wholly even through fire and water to live vertuouſly and pleaſe his Redeemer? who looking upon Heaven, which awaits him, will not be animated to do what is good chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and to ſuffer all croſſes for God Almighty's ſake with fervour and courage?<note place="margin">Ruffi. nu. <hi>107.</hi> &amp; Pelag. libel. <hi>7.</hi> n. <hi>28.</hi>

                        <hi>Ruffinus</hi> relates that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Monk coming unto the Abbot <hi>Aquilius,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained unto him that he found much trouble and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs in keeping of his Cell; To whom the diſcreet Abbot anſwered, My ſon, this proceeds from not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on the perpetual torments we are to ſuffer, nor upon the eternal joy and repoſe, which we hope for. If thou ſhouldeſt ſeriouſly but think on that, though thy Cell were filled and ſwarmed with worms and vermin, and thou ſtoodſt up to the throat in the middle of them, yet wouldeſt thou perſevere in thy recollection without wearineſs, or trouble. The third Vertue is with tears and grief of Soul to endeavour a recommpence for our ſins paſt, and to ſatisfie for them with a dolorous contrition, and bitterneſs of heart, that ſo the eternity of happineſs, which by them was loſt, may with repentance be regained: contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being a vertue ſo potent, that it repairs what is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd; and although it is ſaid that what is done hath no remedy, and that there is no power over what is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51068:29"/>paſt, yet this moſt powerful Vertue is able to undoe what is done, and to prevail upon what is paſt, ſince it takes away our ſins, and makes them as if they had never been committed.</p>

                  <p>But all theſe definitions and declarations of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are not yet ſufficient to expreſs and truly ſet forth the greatneſs of it; neither is it well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> notes, what the Authors, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it, thought of it. That may be rather ſaid, which was ſaid by <hi>Simonides</hi> the Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Cic. l. <hi>2.</hi> de naturae deorum.</note> who when <hi>Hieron</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> intreated him to declare what thing God was, demanded a dayes ſpace to think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave his anſwer; the which paſt, he ſaid he had need of more time to conſider it, and required other two dayes; at the end of thoſe he asked four: which alſo ended, his anſwer was, that the more he thought upon it, the more he found he had to think, and knew leſs how to expreſs it, and that the further he entred into the conſideration of it, the more it hid and obſcured it ſelf from him. The ſame may be ſaid of Eternity, the which is an Abyſs ſo profound, that humane underſtanding finds no footing, but hath ſtill more to conſider, the more it ponders.<note place="margin">De Myſt. Theo.</note> St. <hi>Dionyſius Areapagita</hi> ſpeakiug of God, confeſſes that it cannot be ſaid what he is, but onely what he is not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide what he is. In like manner Eternity cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be declared then by what it is not, and beſide what it is. Eternity is not time, it is not ſpace, it is not an age, it is not a million of ages, but it is more then time, ſpace, or millions of ages. The life wherein thou now art, and which muſt ſhortly have an end, is

If he who is ſick of a Calenture, though laid upon a ſoft and downy Bed, thinks each hour of night an Age, and every minute expects and with impatience wiſhes for the day, how ſhall it fare with thoſe, who, becauſe in this life they ſlept
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51068:30"/>when they were to watch, ſhall in the next lie awake for an eternal night in a Bed of burning fire, without ever hoping for a morning? And certainly if there were in Hell no other pain, than to live in that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal night and ſadneſs, it were enough to aſtoniſh and confound all humane underſtanding.

                        </note> Wherefore St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> pondering with himſelf in his meditations upon Hell, that if a damned perſon ſhould every hundred years let fall but onely one ſmall tear, and thoſe all to be preſerved until that after innumerable Centuries of years they came to equal a Sea, perhaps ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred millions of years may be thought to finiſh Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; No: it would but then begin. Let them turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and keep the ſame ſlow tears of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinner, until they have fill'd another Ocean. Would Eternity then end? No; but then begin, as freſh and new, as the firſt day. Let them repeat the ſame, ten, twenty, an hundred times, until an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Seas ſhall fill and overflow. Shall we then find the bottom of Eternity? No; we have not paſt the Superficies of it, and it ſhall ſtill remain as deep, and unſoundable as at firſt. There are no Numbers, no Arithmetick, that can comprehend the years of Eternity. If the whole Heavens were parchment, and fill'd on both ſides with Numbers, they could not ſum
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51068:31"/>up the leaſt part of that, which hath no parts at all, but is in it ſelf whole, entire, and indiviſible. No Sea hath ſo many drops, no Mountain ſo many grains of ſand, as will ſerve to reckon up the years of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>To declare this more amply, I ſhall relate what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto <hi>Archimedes.</hi> There were ſome Philoſophers of his time, who affirmed that the number of the ſands of the Sea were infinite; others that although they were in themſelves finite, yet they could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under any Number. <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that he might confute both opinions, compoſed a moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ingenious Book, which he dedicated unto King <hi>Gelon;</hi> wherein he proved, that although the world were all fill'd with ſand, and that it were bigger than what it is, yet that the multitude of thoſe grains of ſands were limited, and might alſo be reduced under Numbers; and he himſelf gave the account, to what Number they would ariſe. Since this Philoſopher, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Clavius</hi> did the like; computing how many grains of ſand would fill the whole ſpace betwixt the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fixed Stars and the Earth, making every grain of ſand ſo little and indiviſible, that he allows 10000 of them unto the bigneſs of a poppie, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, and notwithſtanding ſums up this vaſt Number within the ſhort ſpace of one line, all not ſurpaſſing one Unite, and 51 Cyphers. If then ſo many millions of millions may be contained in the length of one line, what ſhall we ſay of the years in Eternity: ſince that not only one line, nor one book, nor all the paper in the world, nor all the world from the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament downwards filled with the Figures of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick were ſufficient to contain one little particle of it, notwithſtanding the multiplication which is made by the adding of every figure? Every Cypher which is added, makes the number ten times more than it was, becauſe a Cypher put after one Unit makes it ten, the ſecond Cypher makes it one hundred, the third
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51068:31"/>one thouſand, and in this manner the Numbers goe multiplying to an immenſe Number in a few Figures. Whereby one may conceive that adding one hundred Cyphers it makes the Numbers riſe to ſuch a pitch, that it far exceeds the capacity of Man's imagination to conceive it. What then would it be, adding ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cyphers as could be contained in a parchment as big as the whole Heaven? Yet all this innumerable Number does not equal the leaſt particle of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which after ſo many numberleſs years paſt, which at length after how long a time ſoever muſt meet an end, would yet remain as if it did but then begin. Let us ſeriouſly think how long were that life to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which ſhould contain an hundred thouſand years; yet we have thought of nothing in reſpect of Eternity. Let us think of ten times, an hundred, a thouſand times as much: ſtill nothing to Eternity; neither have we quitted the leaſt part of it, which is but then beginning. Wherefore <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, <hi>With what years ſhall we ſatiate Eternity,</hi>

                        <hi>ſince it hath no end?</hi> It is ſtill beginning, and nothing but a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore may not unſignificantly be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined: <hi>Eternity is a perpetual beginning, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues without end or diminution.</hi> Let us abſtract from Eternity as many years as there are drops in the Sea, atomes in the Air, leaves in the Fields, grains of ſand in the Earth, or Stars in the Heavens, it will yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue whole and entire. Add as many years unto it, it becomes no greater, nor is further diſtant from its end; ſince it admits none, but in each point and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant receives a beginning. Never, never ſhall it have an end, ever, ever in beginning. Let one imagine, that there were a Mountain of ſand which ſhould reach from the Earth to Heaven, and that an Angel after every thouſand years ſhould take from it one onely grain; how many thouſands of thouſands of years, and millions of millions would paſs before that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain became ſo little, that it would no longer remain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51068:32"/>perceptible? Let the beſt Arithmetician, that is, caſt up the account, how many years would paſs, before that Angel had taken away half of the aforeſaid Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. This ſeems a thing endleſs; but our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is beguiled; for it would have an end, and time would come when one half, and even the whole Mountain would be taken away. Finally, there would be a time, when there would be one only little grain remaining: and this alſo would be removed. But never ſhall we come to the end of Eternity: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conſuming of that whole Mountain of ſand, nothing would be diminiſhed from Eternity: but the Mountain of Eternity would remain as entire, after millions of millions of Ages were paſt, as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. This ſeems to have been ſignified by that of <hi>Abacuch,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>The mountains of Ages are torn in pieces: and the hills of the world ſhall be humbled by the ways of Eternity;</hi> Becauſe one thouſand hills and mountains as big as the whole world, may be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a thouſand times over, whileſt the Eternity of the puniſhment of ſinners paſs over them: which Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can never make an end of paſſing; ſo that thoſe miſerable Souls, who ſuffer in that devouring fire, ſhall ſuffer a thouſand, and a thouſand, and millions of millions of years without coming neerer to the end, than they were the firſt day.</p>

                     <p>What man would endure to lie upon one ſide reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a ſcorching fire for the ſpace of a whole year? But what ſpeak I of lying burning? Who could endure to be laid in a ſoft bed upon one ſide without being permitted to riſe or turn unto the other ſide for the ſame ſpace? This indeed was a rigorous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance performed by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Prophet at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, who appointed him that he ſhould continue laid upon one ſide without riſing for the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51068:32"/>ſpace of 390 days. This was a moſt rigorous pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but by Divine Grace accompliſhed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet. If it be then ſo difficult to lie immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon one ſide for ſo ſhort a time as the ſpace of one year, what ſhall it be for a condemned ſinner to lye ſtretched upon a bed of ſire in that eternal night, and ſadneſs of hell, all ſorts of evils raining down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for a time without end or limit? What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is there, who ſhould conſider and frame a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit of this, but would become another man? who could take delight in a momentary pleaſure of this life, running the danger of thoſe eternal pains in the next? who would dare to ſin at the hazard of ſo great a puniſhment? O how powerful a remedy were it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſordered cuſtoms of ſinners, if they would but ſettle themſelves ſeriouſly to think that Eternity hath no end. O that they would think upon this one half hour in a day, or but ſo much in a week, how quickly would they amend their lives. But this is a thought not to be paſt over in haſte, but leaſurely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with attention and profound conſideration, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating within our ſelves what Eternity is: that it is that which ſhall never have an end, never, never. For as that meat which is not chewed, nor concocted in the ſtomack benefits nothing, ſo the thought of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity without being well ruminated and digeſted will little advantage us.</p>
                     <p>The force of this conſideration appears by an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent related by <hi>Benedictus Renatus</hi> of a certain man vain and vitious, named <hi>Fulk;</hi> the which,<note place="margin">Benedict. Renat. lib. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> as he was given to all ſorts of pleaſure and delicacy, would be ſure not to want a ſoft bed, and a large repoſe. But one night his ſleep failing him, toſſing and turning from ſide to ſide, deſiring every moment that day would break, whileſt he lay thus awake, this thought came into his conſideration, What wouldeſt thou take to lye in this manner for the ſpace of two or three years in continual darkneſs, without converſation of friends,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51068:33"/>or entertainment of thy pleaſures? certainly although thou ſhouldeſt lye at thy eaſe, and upon a ſoft Bed, as thou now doeſt, yet the trouble would be intolerable. But know that thou art not to depart ſo cheap out of this life; thou art not to eſcape hence at thy own choice; at the beſt that can happen, thou art to lye languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy Death-bed, where thou art to paſs many evil and tedious nights, unleſs perchance thou dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, which will be more; and when thou leaveſt that Bed and dyeſt, doſt thou know what Bed ſhall then expect thee? what Couch death hath provided for thee? Thy body certainly ſhall lye upon the hard and cold earth, and be devoured by worms; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſoul, what ſhall become of it? knoweſt thou whither it ſhall goe? aſſuredly according to thy preſent life it ſhall goe to hell, where a terrible Bed of fire awaits thee, not for a year or two, but for a whole Eternity. There thou art to continue in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkneſs, and torments, where a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of years are not ſufficient to ſatisfie for one of thy unlawful pleaſures. There thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee nor Sun, nor Heaven, nor God. Ay me, Ay miſerable me, if this poor want of ſleep be ſo ill to be endured, how ſhall I ſuffer the eternal torments of hell? that which now imports me, is to change my courſe of life; for in this way I now goe I am loſt for ever. Theſe conſiderations imprinted ſo deep a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in his minde of Eternity, that he could not quit the thought of it, until he had reſolved to become a Religious man, but would often ſay with himſelf, What doeſt thou here miſerable man? thou liveſt in the world, and the world affords thee no comfort: thou ſuffereſt many things, which thou wouldeſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly avoid, and wanteſt others, which thou wouldeſt as willingly enjoy. Thou moleſteſt thy ſelf with the cares of this life, and what reward attends thee for all thy trouble? thou enjoyeſt no compleat pleaſure, and if thou didſt, it would not laſt. Seeſt thou not daily thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51068:33"/>who dye, and enter into Eternity? O Eternity, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if thou beeſt not in Heaven, whereſoever thou art, even in this ſoft Bed thou art grievous. I will therefore endeavour to aſſure Heaven, and for a little will not loſe much, nor for what is temporal the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and ſo putting in execution what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, he entered a Religious perſon into the order of the Ciſtercians.</p>

                     <p>All our actions are ſtill to be accompanied with this thought, <hi>For ever.</hi> For ever ſhall be rewarded that which I do well; and that for ever puniſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I grievouſly offend. With this conſideration ſhall a Chriſtian not onely animate himſelf to do good works, but to do them well. <hi>Aelianus</hi> writes of <hi>Iſmenias,</hi>

                        </note> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from the <hi>Thebans</hi> unto the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that being about to deliver his Embaſſage, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that before he ſpake a word, he was to adore the King, <hi>Iſmenias</hi> thinking this honour too much to be beſtowed upon a barbarous Prince, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no wayes to avoid it, fell upon this deviſe. He took his Ring, which anciently was of great eſteem, as ſignifying the quality, and authority of him that wore it, and pulling it from his finger, let it ſecretly fall at the Kings feet whileſt he lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before them, ſaying within himſelf, Not unto thee, but to this Ring. If we in like manner ſhould in all our actions propoſe unto our ſelves Eternity, and wholly reſpect it, we ſhould finde little difficulty in any good work, we went about. Let us therefore fix our eyes and thoughts upon it, which is to be given us for that which may be done in a moment. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, who beſtows upon us a reward without and for troubles ſo ſhort, that they ſcarcely have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. <hi>Euripides,</hi> a famous Poet amongſt the Greeks,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51068:34"/>complained upon a time, that in three whole days he had made but three Verſes, and thoſe not without trouble. <hi>Alceſtides,</hi> another Poet preſent, anſwered, For me one day is ſufficient to make an hundred Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that with eaſe. <hi>Euripides</hi> then replied, It is no marvel, ſince thy Verſes are but for three dayes, and mine are for ever. In the ſame manner <hi>Zeuxis</hi> a moſt excellent Painter, but above all meaſure ſlow, being demanded why he was ſo tedious in his work, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I paint leaſurely, becauſe I paint for ever. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he deceived himſelf; for at this day there is no Picture of his to be ſeen: and for <hi>Euripides</hi> many of his works are loſt. But no good work of the juſt ſhall periſh. Neither have we need ſo much as of a day to gain Eternity. One act of Contrition which is made in a moment does it, and in a moment we gain thoſe joyes which ſhall endure without end. Yet ought we to make uſe of this conſideration of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> and not only to do good works, but to do them ſeriouſly and perfectly well, ſince we work not for this life, but for Eternity, which ought ever to be in our memory.</p>
                     <p>The benefit which <hi>David</hi> reaped by this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was a firm reſolution to mend his life, and change into a new man, animating himſelf to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſervance, and a more high perfection. And ſo in that Pſalm, wherein he ſays, That he thought upon the days of old, and the years of Eternity, he adds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the effect of his Meditation, ſaying, That he was to begin a new, becauſe the change which he found in his heart, he perceived was from the moſt powerful hand of God. Wherefore conſidering that Eternity never ends, but ſtill begins, and that it is wholly a beginning, he determined with ſuch new fervour to give a beginning to a more perfect life, that he would never flagg or be diſmayed in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; willing in this to imitate Eternity, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51068:34"/>which as it is ever beginning, ſo he would ever begin to deſerve it. And what great matter is it, if that, which we are to enjoy or ſuffer, be ever in beginning, that we ſhould likewiſe be ever beginning either to deſerve the one, or flie the other? Our reward is not to fail us: and therefore there is no reaſon why we ſhould fail, and grow weary in our ſervice and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Our joy is ever to begin: Why ſhould not then our endeavours be ever in beginning? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we hope for ſhall never have an end: Why ſhould then our deſervings ever ceaſe? With this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration St. <hi>Arſenius</hi> much profited himſelf, making account that although he had ſerved God many years in a moſt holy life, yet that he did but then begin, repeating often that Speech of <hi>David, Now I begin, Now I begin.</hi> We ought never to look back upon our labours paſt, but ſtill to animate our ſelves to labour anew for God and his Service: as did the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays of himſelf,<note place="margin">Philip. <hi>3.</hi> Vide Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuet. in vita St. Pauli.</note> That he did forget what was paſt, that he did inlarge his heart and mind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it for that which was to come; the which the Apoſtle ſpake in a time when he had ſuffered much, and done ſuch ſervices unto God in the good of Souls, as he had already laboured more than all the Apoſtles. After he had entred into the Synagogues of <hi>Damaſous,</hi> and publikely preached Jeſus Chriſt with ſo evident danger of his life, that if he had not eſcaped over the walls of the City, he had been cut in a thouſand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: After that in <hi>Arabia</hi> he had converted many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, many in <hi>Tarſua</hi> and in <hi>Antioch:</hi> After he had been rapt up into the third Heaven: After that he had been elected by the Holy Ghoſt to be an Apoſtle, and wrought great and prodigious Miracles: After that he had paſt over <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> all <hi>Greece,</hi> and the better part of <hi>Europe,</hi> converting innumerable Soules: After he had diſtributed great Alms, gathering them with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, made long journeys, and brought them unto the poor in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> After the ſuffering of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51068:35"/>perſecutions: After having been thrice ſtoned and once left for dead: After having been often whipt, and often apprehended: After infinite ſervices performed for the Church: Alter all theſe it ſeemed unto him, that he had ſuffered nothing, done nothing for Chriſt, and he forgot it all, as if it had been the firſt day of his converſion, determining ſtill to doe more, to ſuffer more, to labour more, to begin anew, eſteeming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after ſo many labours and ſervices to be an uſeleſs and an unprofitable ſervant, following the counſel of our Saviour when he ſayes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.</note> 
                        <hi>After ye have done all what I have commanded you to doe, ſay, ye are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that ye have done what ye ought have done.</hi> Let a man compare his labours, his zeal, his preaching, his charity with that of the Apoſtle, and he will find that he hath not yet begun. If then the Apoſtle, who at that time exceeded the merits of divers Saints who have dyed in great holineſs, and yet forgot all, judging he had done nothing, but turned to begin afreſh, we who have not yet begun, wherefore ſhall we be weary before we begin? let us ever begin anew, ſince Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which we hope for is ever to be new, and ever to begin. <hi>Let us not glory,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus, in the merits of our life paſt: neither let us eſteem our ſelves for any thing we have already done, but let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir our ſelves as freſhly, and with as much fervour, as if we did but that day begin, and were that day alſo to dye.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe ſecond condition of Eternity is to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and to perſevere without change: which the Ancients gave us to underſtand by many moſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51068:35"/>Symbols. Some figured it by painting of a Chair;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 6.</note> conformable unto which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, That he ſaw the Lord ſitting on high upon a Throne, ſetting forth in this ſettled poſture the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability and greatneſs of his Eternity. And St. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Apocalyps</hi> often celebrates the Seat of God, as repreſenting his eternal duration. More clearly the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</note> unto whom God vouchſafed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as he was eternal; whereupon he calls him the Ancient of dayes, and ſayes he beheld him with his hair all white, and ſeated upon a Throne. From the ſame conſideration the <hi>Naſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nes,</hi> a certain People of <hi>Affrick;</hi> when any amongſt them was about to die, cauſed him to ſit, and in that poſture to expire; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby the eſtate wherein his Soul was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fently to enter. And for the ſame cauſe they interred their dead ſitting; giving us thereby to underſtand, that reſt and repoſe were not to be ſought for until death, when we were to enter the gates of Eternity. This life is no place to ſit in; we are not here to ſtay; the miſery which we find in it ſufficiently declares, that God made it not for that purpoſe. This life is but lent us, we are not to abide in it, but to walk apace unto the Mountain of Eternity. It is ſo miſerable, that even it ſelf informs us of another life, wherein we ſhall finde reſt, ſince here we cannot meet it. In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all our unhappineſs, all our miſeries are to ceaſe; there the tears of this valley are to be wiped from our eyes; there our troubles are to find eaſe; there the unquietneſs of our hearts is to have repoſe. In this world no manner of life, no ſort of eſtate, no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, no greatneſs of dignity, no abundance of riches, no felicity of fortune can ever give reſt unto the poſſeſſor. For this reaſon the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which they erected to their deceaſed Emperors, made them ſtill ſitting; whereby they would ſignifie, that all the felicity of this world could not beſtow true reſt, and even upon him, who was the Maſter of it,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51068:36"/>until the end of life. Man is born, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, to labour. Until death there is no reſt. Let us not then ſeek it here, but let us place the chair of our joyes where it may be firm and ſtable, and not in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs and turmoyles of things temporal, where death at leaſt will certainly overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>Others painted Eternity in the form of a Snake; to note the condition of a perpetual continuance not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto change, but remaining ſtill in the ſame eſtate and vigour. For as this Serpent wants wings, feet, and hands, which are the extremities of other creatures: ſo Eternity wants an end, which is the extremity of things temporal.<note place="margin">Apud Euſeb. l. <hi>1.</hi> de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> Moreover as Serpents, although without feet, wings, or any extrinſecal organ of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet by their great livelineſs of ſpirit move more ſwiftly then thoſe creatures which have them: ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity without dayes, or nights, or changes, which are the feet and wings of time, out-ſtrips and over-go's all things that are temporal. Beſides, Serpents enjoy ſuch a vivacity and length of life, that <hi>Philon Biblius</hi> ſaith, they die not, unleſs they be kill'd, and that they hardly know a natural death, being not ſubject to thoſe changes of other creatures, from youth to age, and from health to ſickneſs, but preſerve themſelves ſtill freſh and young by the often renewing and caſting of their old skins; neither have they like other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any determinate ſize of their greatneſs, but ſo long as they live encreaſe in bigneſs after the manner of Eternity, which hath no limit, change, or declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a condition of all others moſt to be feared by the wicked, who are for ever to continue in thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments without the leaſt refreſhment, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as the comfort of changing one torment for another. St. <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſaid of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> that his reſt was to change his labours: and certainly to change one pain for another, although not in it ſelf much leſs, is yet ſome eaſe. But even this ſhall be wanting unto the damned, who ſhall never be permitted ſo much
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51068:36"/>change, as to turn from one ſide to another. A fearful thing, that being now five thouſand years paſt, ſince the firſt damned Soul was plunged into hell, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all this time no change ſhould afford him the leaſt eaſe. How many alterations have ſince happened in this world? yet none in his moſt bitter torments. The world hath once been deſtroyed by an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, eight onely perſons remaining alive. After which all men enjoying an equal liberty, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Tyrants over the reſt, and raiſed the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which endured 1240 years, and then not without the general uproar and turmoyl of all <hi>Aſia</hi> paſſed unto the <hi>Medes,</hi> under whom it continued 300 years. Which ended, it came unto the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and from them unto the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from whom, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater alteration then any of the former, it paſſed unto the <hi>Romans;</hi> under whom alſo it hath ſince fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Amongſt all which changes and revolutions of the world, none hath yet paſſed over that miſerable and unfortunate creature. Beſides theſe alterations in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, what alterations hath nature it ſelf ſuffered? what Iſlands hath the Sea ſwallowed up? one of which, as <hi>Plato</hi> reports, was bigger than all <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi> And what others hath it caſt up of new. What buildings, or to ſay better, what Mountains hath the Earthquakes left ſecure? many Hills have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, or turned topſie turvie; others have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and ſprung up never known before. What Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been ſunk? what Rivers dried up: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vomited forth through new Channels? what Towers have not fallen? what Walls not been ruin'd? what Monuments not defaced? how often hath the face of things changed? how many revolutions have the greateſt Kingdoms ſuffered? and this miſerable ſinner hath in all this time not given one turn. How many times hath the year renewed it ſelf? how many Springs: how many Autumns paſt? and yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in that obſcure night, as in his firſt entrance into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51068:37"/>that place of torments, The Sun hath compaſſed this elemental World a Million, and 700000 times; and yet this wretched Soul could never once change his poſture, or remove one pace ſince his firſt falling into hell. Beſides this, what troubles, what labours have been paſſed by thoſe innumerable people, who have lived from the beginning of the world until this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and are now all vaniſht? what ſickneſſes have been ſuffered? what torments, what griefs endured, and are now all forgotten? but no grief, nor torment of that unfortunate Sinner hath in theſe 5000 years paſſed away, or ſhall ever become leſs. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out with the pain of his Gout; <hi>Ariſtarcus</hi> was grieved with his Dropſie, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> was afflicted with his Falling-ſickneſs; <hi>Theopompus</hi> afflicted with his Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; <hi>Tobias</hi> with his blindneſs, and holy <hi>Job</hi> with his Leproſie: yet thoſe griefs had their end. But all thoſe evils which joyntly poſſeſs this miſerable creature have not, or ever ſhall have change or period. They of <hi>Rabatha</hi> were ſawed in the middeſt: others thraſhed to death with Flails: others burnt alive in Furnaces: others torn in pieces by wild Beaſts: <hi>Anaxarcus</hi> was pounded in a Mortar, <hi>Perillus</hi> burnt in a brazen Bull. But all thoſe pains paſſed away, and are now no more: but that damned perſon hath not yet made an end; or to ſay better, hath not yet begun to paſs any one of his torments, which 100000 years hence ſhall be as new and ſenſible unto him, as they were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. What deſperation muſt then ſeiſe upon him, when he ſees a change in all things, and in his pains and torments none? for if even the pleaſures of this life, if continued the ſame, convert into griefs, how ſhall thoſe pains, which never change, be ſuffered? what ſpite and madneſs ſhall poſſeſs him, when he ſhall behold the Flames of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> the Stripes of St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Aneira,</hi> the Croſs of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Faſts of St. <hi>Hilarion,</hi> the Haircloth of <hi>Simeon Stylites,</hi> the Diſciplines of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> all the Torments of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51068:37"/>Martyrs, and Penances of Confeſſors now paſſed, and turned into eternal joyes: but his own pains neither to paſs nor change, neither any hopes left either of ending his torments or himſelf? Theſe are evils to be feared, and not thoſe tranſitory ones of the world, which either change, grow leſs or end, or at leaſt make an end of him, who ſuffers them. Let not therefore the ſick perſon be grieved and vexed with his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor the poor man with his wants, nor the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his croſſes, ſince the evils of this life are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changed with time, eaſed by counſel and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or at leaſt ended by death. But this miſerable wretch in Hell cannot ſo much as comfort himſelf with the hope of dying, becauſe in that multitude of torments, if there were the leaſt hope of end, it would be ſome eaſe, ſome refreſhment, which muſt not there happen, the Gates on all parts being ſhut to comfort. Hope beguiles us in our evils, and in ſome ſort frees us from the ſenſe of ſuffering. There is no labour or toil ſo great, which hope makes not tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The moſt afflicted and wretched perſons live and ſubſiſt with expectation, that one day their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will change or end. But that eaſe and comfort is denied the damned, whoſe unhappineſs is never to have an end, nor their torments alteration. They would eſteem it for a comfort, if a thouſand years hence they might be ſure of that little drop of water begg'd by the rich glutton: But what ſpeak I of a thouſand years? it after an hundred thouſand, after a thouſand times ſo many, ſo that ſome certain time were prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the door but of ſome ſmall hope ſet open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If all the ſpace, which is taken up by the Earth, covered by the Water, filled with the Air, and encompaſſed by the Heavens, were full of grains of Wheat: And a damned Soul were told, that after all that Wheat were eaten by ſome ſmall Bird, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every hundred thouſand years ſhould come to take one grain, and when it ſhould have taken away the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51068:38"/>laſt, they would give it that drop of water which was demanded by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it would be comforted to ſee this onely change, and ſo ſmall an eaſe in the midſt of his pains. Yet it ſhall not have this; and after ſo many millions of millions of years the miſerable wretch ſhall be in the ſame torments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the ſame manner, and as much void of all comfort as ever. This is it ſhall burſt the hearts of the damned, when they ſhall perceive all remedies to be then impoſſible, which in this life were ſo eaſie to be obtained. With the crums of bread, which fell from his table, the rich Glutton might have purchaſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs; and now the refreſhment of one drop of water is denied him. What rancour ſhall they have againſt themſelves, when they ſhall remember that by the forbearance of one momentary pleaſure they might have eſcaped eternal torments? How raging will their very entrails be to conſider, that that is now paſt help, which was heretofore ſo eaſily to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore a Chriſtian open his eyes, and, whileſt he may, remedy that, which hereafter, when he would, will be impoſſible. Now is the time accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now is the time of Salvation, now is the time of pardon and indulgence, now that may be gained in a moment, which all Eternity cannot hereafter redeem. What other thing was ſignified unto us by the flames of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> furnace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</note> which, as the Scripture ſaith, mounted unto the height of fourty nine Cubits? It doth not ſay, fifty, as is uſual in other places to give the compleat number, although ſome be wanting. And who, I pray you, approached ſo near unto that flame, which flew and moved up and down in the air, that could ſo punctually meaſure the height of it to ariſe juſt unto fourty nine Cubits, and not to reach fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? But herein was the Myſtery, which we are about to ſpeak off. The Number of fifty was the Number of the Jubilee, and ſignified Indulgence and Pardon, and by the flames of that Furnace were figured the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51068:38"/>flames of Hell: which how far ſoever they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the torments of this life, yet ſhall never attain unto a Jubilee, and remiſſion of their pains. Now, 'tis true they may: Now every year, every moneth, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, every hour, and every moment is a time of Pardon and Jubilee. What would a damned Soul give for one onely quarter of an hour of thoſe whole days and weeks, which men miſpend in this life, for to be able to do penance in? Let us not therefore be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of a thing ſo precious; let us not loſe time, and and with it Eternal Glory. The time of this life is ſo precious, that St. <hi>Bernardin</hi> dares give it this exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſaying, <hi>That time is worth as much as God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it God is gained. Let us not therefore fling away a thing of that value, but let us make uſe of this cheap bargain, purchaſing with time Eternity, and God himſelf the Lord of Eternity: fulfilling that which was ſaid by <hi>Eccleſiaſticus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>If there be due unto thee eternal bitterneſs, and thou mayſt eſcape it by ſuffering what is temporal, certainly thou haſt redeemed great matters for a ſmall price.</hi> In bleſſings eternal it is likewiſe a great comfort to have them free from change, ſo as they can neither end nor diminiſh; and that temporal Goods changing and conſuming themſelves, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſame firm and ſtable condition for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Let a Chriſtian compare the brevity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of the things of this life with the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and eternal duration of thoſe of the other. Let him ſeriouſly obſerve the difference betwixt thoſe two words, <hi>Now,</hi> and <hi>Ever.</hi> The fools of this world ſay, Let us now rejoyce; The wiſe and vertuous ſay, it is better that we forbear our pleaſures now, that we may hereafter enjoy eternal happineſs. The worldlings ſay, Let us now live daintily and fare deliciouſly: The Servants of Chriſt ſay, Let us dye in the fleſh that we may live ever without change. The Sinners ſay, Let

Compare theſe two, and ſee who are the wiſer; thoſe who aim only at which endures but this momentary inſtant <hi>Now,</hi> or thoſe who look after Eternity, which laſts for ever; thoſe who ſhall ſuffer eternally without any profit at all, or thoſe who are content to ſuffer a little in this world for ſo great a gain, as is the Kingdom of Heaven.

                     <p> How Eternity is without compariſon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom what is already ſpoken may be collected the third Quality of Eternity, which is to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon. For as there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt what is infinite and what is finite, ſo there can be none betwixt what is Eternal, and what is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And as the Mountain <hi>Olympus</hi> (or if any greater in the world) is as far diſtant from the immenſity of God, as the ſmalleſt grain of ſand, ſo a thouſand years are as far ſhort of Eternity as the twinckling of an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51068:39"/>eye. Wherefore <hi>Boëtius</hi> ſays, that there is more ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude betwixt a moment of time and ten thouſand years, than betwixt ten thouſand years and Eternity. There is no expreſſion which can ſufficiently ſet forth the greatneſs of what is Eternal, nor which can explicate the brevity of time, and littleneſs of what is Temporal. Wherefore <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.</note> when he conſidered what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince God created the world until his time, calls all thoſe Ages, which were already paſt, by the name of dayes, ſaying, <hi>I thought upon the days of old.</hi> And it is not much that he ſhould call Ages dayes, when in another place he ſayes a thouſand years in the preſence of God are but as yeſterday.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Joan.</hi> 2.</note> And St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it yet more fully, when he calls all thoſe years, which were to paſs betwixt his time and the end of the world, whereof 1600 are already run, but an hour. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to think upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which in it ſelf is but one, and, as the Saints ſpeak, one day, he calls it Eternal years, augmenting as much as he could the conception of Eternity, and diminiſhing that of time. For the ſame reaſon the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſetting forth the Glory of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, ſpeaks in the plural number, That <hi>they ſhall ſhine like Stars for perpetual Eternities;</hi> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, that the ordinary Number did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to declare what Eternity was: and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates it by the number of many Eternities, adding for more amplification the Epithete of <hi>perpetual.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.</note> But endeavour we never ſo much, we declare nothing of it. Let the Prophets turn themſelves wholly into tongues, let them call it perpetual Eternities; let them call it Eternity of Eternities; let them call it many dayes; let them call it Ages of Ages; all falls ſhort to explicate the infinite duration which it hath. Wherefore <hi>Eliu</hi> ſpeaking of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 36.</note> ſays his years were ineſtimable, becauſe no years imaginable could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with his Eternity. Betwixt a minute and 100000 years there is proportion: but betwixt 100000 years,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51068:40"/>and Eternity none at all. Well may a quarter of an hour be compared unto a million of years, but a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of years with Eternity holds no compariſon, in reſpect of which all time vaniſhes and diſappears: neither is a million of years more than a moment, ſince neither have proportion with Eternity, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it are both equal, or (to ſay better) are both nothing.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.</note> Wherefore the Wiſe man ſaid, <hi>That if a man had lived many years, and thoſe all in pleaſure, yet ought he to remember the time of darkneſs, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes,</hi> (for ſo he calls Eternity) <hi>the which when they ſhall come, all that is paſt will be found to be vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> If <hi>Cain</hi> had lived and enjoyed all the felicities of the Earth even until this day, and at this inſtant died, what ſhould he now poſſeſs of all his delights? What would remain unto him of all his dayes paſt? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no more than remained unto his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> whom he murdred more than 5500 years ago; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually had both their dayes diſappeared, and <hi>Cain</hi> had no more left of his ſports and pleaſures, ſo fully and for ſo long a time enjoyed, than <hi>Abel</hi> of his ſhort life, but more to ſuffer in that time of darkneſs, and the many dayes of Eternity.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.</note> For if, as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith, <hi>The evils of one hour make many pleaſures to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and the moment wherein a man dyes bereaves him of all he did in life either for delight or appetite, why ſhall not then the torments of Hell make him forget all the pleaſures of the earth, and the Eternity of evils ſtrip him of a few and momentary paſtimes? If with the grief of one hour the pleaſures of many years are forgotten, why ſhall not the pleaſure of one moment, for which thou falleſt into Hell, be forgotten with the malice of many years? And if the inſtant of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death deprive thee of all thy vain contents and entertainments paſt, what ſhall be done by the eternal death of thy Soul? In that inſtant, wherein <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus</hi> dyed, what continued with him of all his ſports and delights? Nothing. At this preſent, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51068:40"/>years meaſured in the Eternity of Hell, what now remains with him but torments upon torments, griefs upon griefs, pains upon pains, evils upon evils, and a perpetual <hi>Woe is me,</hi> which ſhall laſt as long as God is God? The moment wherein we dye (as touching the things of this life) makes all men equal. He who lived long, and he who died ſhortly: he who enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, and he who had but little: he who was glutted with all ſorts of delights, and he who was fed with the bread of ſorrow, and vexed with all ſorts of griefs and misfortunes, all are now the ſame, all are ended in death; the one is not ſenſible of his pleaſure, nor the other grieved with his labours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expiration of an hundred years in a moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid life what felt St. <hi>Romualdus</hi> of all his auſterities? What the moſt penitent <hi>Simeon Stylites,</hi> after four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of a prodigious penance, wherein he quitted not his hair-ſhirt by day or night? What felt he at his death of his continual faſts and long prayers? Certainly of pain no more, than if he had ſpent all that long time in the wanton pleaſures of <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> Of griefs he found nothing, but of joy and glory he now does, and ever ſhall in abundance. What felt St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Ancira</hi> of his twenty eight years tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuffered by the furious rage and madneſs of Tyrants? Certainly of Pain no more, then if during that time he had enjoyed all the delights of the world, but of Glory an Eternity. For if the malice of one hour make the contents of an hundred years to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: much more will the happineſs of an Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blot out the remembrance of 28 years ſufferance. O prodigious moment of death, which gives an end unto all that is Temporal; which tranſmits and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all things; which concludes the guſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſinners, and begins their torments; which ends the labours and auſterities of Saints, and begins their Glory and joyes Eternal.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore a Chriſtian ſeriouſly conſider, that the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51068:41"/>pleaſures, by which he ſins, and the mortifications; by which he ſatisfies, are equally to have an end: and that the torments which he deſerves by the one, and the joyes which he merits by the other, are equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have an end: and let him then make election of that which ſhall be beſt for him. Let him ſee if it be not better to work himſelf an eternal Crown of glory out of the ſleight and momentary ſufferings of this life; And let not the length of life affright him: for there is nothing long in reſpect of Eternity. It was therefore well laid of <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Pſ. <hi>45.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>all which hath an end is ſhort.</hi> A hundred years of penance have an end, and are therefore ſhort: a thouſand years, a hundred thouſand Millions have their end, and are therefore in the appearance of what is immenſe but little, and in reſpect of Eternity no more then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. In the ſame manner we are to look upon a thouſand years as upon an hour; and for it ſelf a long life is no more to he deſired then a ſhort, ſince both in reſpect of Eternity bear the ſame bulk. And as in reſpect of a ſolid body a thouſand ſuperficies's bear no more proportion then one, all of them together being as incapable of making up the leaſt particle of ſolidity, as one onely: ſo in reſpect of Eternity one year is not leſs then a thouſand, nor a thouſand more than one. And upon all time, although it were a Million of ages, we are to look as upon an inſtant, and upon all, which is temporal, as upon a ſuperficies, which hath onely an appearance, but nothing of ſubſtance; neither can all time, and all temporal goods together make up one onely good of Eternity. If the whole earth be but a point in reſpect of the Heavens, which are notwithſtanding of a finite and limited greatneſs, what great matter is it, if all time be but as an inſtant in reſpect of Eternity, which is infinite and without limit? Betwixt the Earth, nay betwixt the leaſt grain of ſand, and the higheſt Heaven there is a proportion: both have quantity; but betwixt a thouſand years and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51068:41"/>Eternity none at all, and are therefore leſs then a point. O blindneſs of men, who are ſo beſotted with time, that in life they deſire pleaſure, and in death a memorial, and both in death and life a fame and renown; for what? even for a moment, for an inſtant. Wherefore deſireſt thou pleaſure in life, which to morrow is to end? Wherefore deſireſt thou a vain memory after death, which can endure no longer than the world, whoſe end will not be long deferred? And although it ſhould yet laſt for a million of ages, it were but ſhort, ſince thoſe alſo muſt conclude, and all were but as a moment in reſped of Eternity. As the Immenſity of God is in reſpect of place, ſo is Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reſpect of time; and as in reſpect of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of God the whole Sea is no greater than a drop of water, nor an atome in the air leſs than the whole world; ſo in reſpect of Eternity a hundred thouſand years, and half a quarter of an hour are the ſame. If God then ſhould beſtow upon thee this life onely for a quarter of an hour, and that thou knoweſt likewiſe that the world within an hour after thy death were to end alſo, wouldeſt thou ſpend that ſhort time in oſtentation and ſetting forth thy ſelf, whereby to raiſe a fame, that might endure that ſhort time after thy life? no certainly: thou wouldeſt buſie thy ſelf with other thoughts, thou wouldeſt think of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to die well, and not trouble thy ſelf in leaving a vain fame and memory, which were ſo ſmall a time to over-laſt thee. Know then that thou oughteſt to do the ſame, although thou wert certain to live a hundred years, and the world to endure a hundred thouſand after thee. For all which hath an end, is ſhort, and all time in reſpect of Eternity is but a day, an hour, a moment. Remember therefore the ſaying of St. <hi>John,</hi> who ſaid his time was in the laſt hour of the world, although there then wanted many years: all which in reſpect of Eternity were but as one hour. So then if thou wouldeſt not be ſollicitous of leaving a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51068:42"/>Name behind thee, if the world were to continue but an hour, no more oughteſt thou to be now, although it were to endure for many ages.</p>
                  <p>If thou kneweſt for certain that thou had'ſt to live a hundred years, and that during that time thou ſhouldeſt have nothing to eat, or ſuſtain thy ſelf, but what thou dreweſt from the ſtore and treaſure of ſome great King, and that too in the ſmall ſpace of an hour, wouldeſt thou ſpend that hour in walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in vain converſation and entertainments? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no: thou wouldeſt not ceaſe from labouring and making haſte to load thy ſelf with thoſe treaſures. How art thou then ſo careleſs, knowing that thy Soul is to live for an eternity, and that thou haſt nothing to ſuſtain it with hereafter, but what thou gaineſt by thy merits within the ſpace of this ſhort life? look how ſhort a time is allowed thee to provide for Eternity: How art thou then ſo negligent, as to paſs it in vain pleaſures? how comeſt thou then to laugh, and not to weep rather, and tear thy fleſh with rigid penance and mortifications? More is an hour in reſpect of a hundred years, than a hundred thouſand are in reſpect of Eternity: And therefore if in that hour, becauſe the time appeared but ſhort, thou wouldeſt not be ſloathful in furniſhing thy ſelf for a hundred years, much leſs oughteſt thou to be ſlow in thoſe hundred years of life to provide for Eternity. Conſider alſo what a hundred years are in reſpect of a million; and a million of years in reſpect of Eternity. If for a hundred years ſpent in torments thou wert to enjoy a million of years in pleaſure and content, certainly thou hadſt a moſt advantagious bargain, ſince thou receiveſt ten thouſand times more than thou gaveſt. What a purchaſe haſt thou then, if not for a hundred years of pain, but for a ſhort hour ſpent in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſome one vain pleaſure thou receiveſt an Eternity of glory, in reſpect of which a million of years are but as air inſtant? See then how ſhort is the ſpace
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51068:42"/>of this life to gain the eternal; ſee how ſhort is all time to merit Eternity. Well did St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>39.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>For an eternal reſt thou wert in reaſon to undergoe an eternal labour, and for an eternal felicity to endure eternal pains.</hi> How then can the ſhort labours of this life ſeem tedious unto thee? queſtionleſs there is no juſt Soul in Heaven, nor damned in Hell, that ſo often as he caſts his eyes upon Eternity, is not aſtoniſht, that ſo ſhort a thing, as this life, ſhould be the Key of ſo long a happineſs in the one, or miſery in the other. See then how cheap thou haſt an Eternity of glory, the which is an infinite for a finite. Weigh a thouſand years, weigh a thouſand millions in counterpoiſe with Eternity; they weigh nothing: all is bat ſmoak and ſtraw; there is no compariſon betwixt infinite and finite; betwixt what is real, and what is painted. Well did <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſay, that <hi>Time wat the Image of Eternity;</hi> conformable unto which <hi>David</hi> ſaid, That man paſſes away in an Image; as if he ſhould have ſaid he paſſes away in time. The ſame which is ſaid of Time, may be ſaid of Goods and Evils temporal, which paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in time, which are all but counterfeited and painted ſtuff in reſpect of thoſe, which are eternal. See then how cheap thou haſt a glory without end even for a ſhort and tranſitory toyle, a true and real hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for a painted labour. Certainly thou oughteſt not onely to eſchew the pleaſures of this life, but even to abhorre them, and to ſeek Eternity through trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, fire and ſwords. For as Eternity holds no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with Time, ſo it ought during Time to be ſought with fervour, diligence and incomparable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid of Wiſdom,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.</note> that in her right hand ſhe held Eternity, or length of dayes, and in her left riches and glory; to ſignify with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs we ought to ſeek the eternal, and to preferre vertue before wealth and honours. For as the right hand is poſſeſt of more force and vigour than the left, ſo we ought to hold faſt and preſerve the eternal with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51068:43"/>all our ſtrength, but not the temporal: which, how glorious ſoever they appear, we are but ſleightly to lay hold on, ſince they profit nothing. Things, which have an end, ſink as it were into the abyſs of nothing, and are as if they had not been at all. Neither ſpeak I onely of the pleaſures of life, but even of life it ſelf, which is nothing but a ſhadow of a being in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of an Eternity. Conſider that thy pleaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou hadſt them, had for an Eternity no being, and once paſt ſhall for another Eternity never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. What are they then more than if they had not been at all? all of them begin, and end in the middle of Eternity, which neither hath beginning nor ending: and are now ſunk and drunk up in that vaſt abyſs, as if they had never been. And therefore little ſhall, what is temporal and paſſes away, profit thee, unleſs thou draw from it ſome fruit, which is permanent and eternal.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it may be collected out of that which is ſpoken what Time is, and what temporal life, and thoſe things, which paſs along in Time, are: let us notwithſtanding, having already treated of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſider it now more particularly, that we may from thence frame a more lively conception of the baſeneſs of things Temporal, and greatneſs of Eternal. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines Time to be the <hi>Meaſure of Motion;</hi> becauſe where there is no change or ſucceſſion, there is no time.

                     </note> in ſo much as all agree in this, that Time is but an accident of a thing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, as is motion. Wherefore <hi>Avicenna</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon affirmed, that Time was more invalid, vain, and inconſiderable than Motion. See then what it is to truſt unto humane life; ſince it is a member of that which is ſo unconſtant and rapid as Time, which runs and paſſes away according to the courſe of the Sun, and revolutions of Stars in the Firmament, whoſe ſwiftneſs not onely exceeds the flight of birds, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſurpaſſes the wind it ſelf. Know then that death follows thee not with leaden feet: it hath wings and comes flying in purſuit of thee with ſuch ſwiftneſs, as greater cannot be imagined: it exceeds not only the birds of the air, but a diſcharged Canon moves not with that fury, as it runs after thee, and will at laſt not fail to overtake thee. Call to remembrance the ſwifteſt things within thy apprehenſion, and they all move but the pace of a Tortoiſe in compariſon of Death. A Falcon moves with great ſwiftneſs after a Heron; but all her ſpeed is flegm in reſpect of that of Time, and Death, which runs like an armed horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to lay hold on thee. More ſwift than the motion of the bird is that of the Fowlers arrow, ſince it hits and kills her flying; but dull and ſlow is the ſwifteſt arrow in reſpect of that which Death aims at thee, even from the firſt moment of thy birth. What can be imagined more ſwift than a flaſh of lightning? yet that moves leaſurely in reſpect of Death, which runs after thee with a motion equal to that of the Stars in the Firmament, whoſe ſwiftneſs is ſo prodigious, that, according to the more moderate account of <hi>Clavius,</hi> they run in one day more than a thouſand ſeventeen millions and a half of leagues, and in one hour more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51068:44"/>than forty two millions. After this rate doth death purſue thee. How is it, that thou trembleſt not? how comes it that thou feareſt it not? now is the bow drawn, now the arrow let looſe, and already in the way to hit thee. Why doeſt thou ſtrive to ſhun it, and doeſt not rather humble and prepare thy ſelf to receive it? If one ſhould tell thee that a whole tire of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery were immediately to be diſcharged againſt thee, and no way left to avoid the ſtroaks, how wouldeſt thou be amazed? but if thou perceived that fire were already given, the very noiſe perhaps would kill thee. Know then that the Artillery of death with much more fury is already ſhot, and there is no quarter of an hour wherein it flies not more than ten millions of leagues to overtake thee: and yet from whence it parted, and where it now is, thou knoweſt not. Wert thou cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it were far hence, yet it runs with ſo precipitate a courſe, that it will not fail in a ſhort time to reach thee; and therefore thou being ignorant of what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it is, thou oughteſt every moment to expect it, ſince every moment it may be with thee.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this of ſwiftneſs, we are to conſider that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition of time noted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that it is <hi>The meaſure of motion acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rding to the precedent, &amp; ſubſequent;</hi> which is the ſame, as it he ſhould have ſaid, Time is the meaſure of motion, in as much as it contains parts after parts in a continual ſucceſſion; the which, as <hi>Averroes</hi> notes, is eſſentially included in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, as not having capacity to preſent things at once and together, but ſucceſſively and by parts: ſome leaving to be, that others may ſuccced, the firſt parts every moment dying, that the ſecond may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their places. Thoſe goods of life, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our infancy, leave us in our youth: and thoſe of our youth, when we become old. The candor, ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and innocency of children is loſt when they leave their coats; and the ſtrength and vigour of youth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not with the wiſdom and judgment of age. It is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51068:44"/>not in the power of Time to give us altogether, but the goods of life being limited, it beſtows them with a limited and reſtrained hand: Even life it ſelf it gives us but by peeces, and mingles as many parts of death, as it gives of life. The age of Infancy dies, when we enter into that of Childhood; that of Childhood, when we become Youths; that of youth, when we come to the age of Manhood; that, when we are old, and even old age it ſelf expires, when we become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit: ſo that during the ſame life we find many deaths, and yet can hardly perſwade our ſelves that we ſhall die one. Let us caſt our eyes upon our life paſt, let us conſider what is become of our Infancy, Childhood, and Youth; they are now dead in us. In the ſame manner ſhall thoſe ages of our life, which are to come, die alſo. Neither do we onely die in the principal times of life, but every hour, every moment includes a kinde of death in the ſucceſſion and change of things. What content is there in life, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dies not by ſome ſucceeding ſorrow? what afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pain, which is not followed by ſome equal or greater grief then it ſelf? why are we grieved for what is abſent, ſince it offends us being preſent? what we deſire with impatience, being poſſeſt, brings care and ſollicitude, loſs, grief, and affliction. The ſhort time which any pleaſure ſtayes with us, it is not to be enjoyed wholly, and all at once, but taſted by parts; ſo as when the ſecond part comes, we feel not the pleaſure of the firſt, leſſening it ſelf every moment: and we our ſelves ſtill dying with it, there being no inſtant of life, wherein death gains not ground of us. The motion of the Heavens is but the ſwift turn of the ſpindle, which rol's up the thread of our lives: and a moſt fleet horſe, upon which death runs poſt after us. There is no moment of life, wherein death hath not equal juriſdiction; and, as a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſaith, there is no point of life, which we divide not with death: ſo as, if well conſidered, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51068:45"/>live but one onely point, and have not life, but for this preſent inſtant. Our years paſt are now vaniſht, and we enjoy no more of them, than if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead; the years to come we yet live not, and poſſeſs no more of them, than if we were not yet born. Yeſterday is gone, to morrow we know not what ſhall be: of to day many hours are paſt, and we live them not, others are to come, and whether we ſhall live them or no, is uncertain; ſo that, all counts caſt up, we live but this preſent moment, and in this alſo we are dying; ſo that we cannot ſay that life is any thing, but the half of an inſtant, and an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible point divided betwixt it and death. With rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſaid, may this temporal life be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The ſhadow of death,</hi> ſince under the. ſhadow of life death ſteals upon us; and as at every ſtep the body takes, the ſhadow takes another, ſo at every pace our life moves forward, death equally advances with it. And as Eternity hath this proportion, that it is ever in beginning, and is therefore a perpetual beginning, ſo life is ever ending and concluding: and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be called a perpetual end, and a continual death. There is no pleaſure in life, which, although it ſhould laſt twenty continued years, that can be preſent with us longer than an inſtant, and that with ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe, that in it death no leſs approaches, than life is enjoyed. Time is of ſo ſmall a being and ſubſtance, and conſequently our life,<note place="margin">

And as we cannot perfectly enjoy the ſight of ſome gallant Cavalier deckt with jewels, and adorned with glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bravery, who with bridle on the neck paſſed in a full Careere before us: ſo are we not able perfectly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51068:45"/>to enjoy the things of this life, which are ſtill in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never reſt one moment, but run headlong on, until they daſh themſelves in peeces upon the rock of death, and periſh in their end.

                  <p>BEhold then what is Time, and what thy Life, and ſee if there can be any thing imagined more ſwift, and more inconſtant than it.

                     </gap> thoſe things, which it preſerves, ſo Time diſparages and takes away the value of thoſe that end in it. The leaſt joy of Heaven is to be eſteemed as infinite, becauſe it is infinite in duration; and the greateſt content of the earth is to be valued as nothing, becauſe it ends and concludes in nothing. The leaſt torment in hell ought to cauſe an immenſe fear, becauſe it is to laſt without end, and the greateſt pains of this world are not to affright us, ſince they are to ceaſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. By how much Eternity enobles and adds unto the greatneſs of thoſe things which are eternal, by ſo much doth Time vilifie, and debaſe thoſe things, which are temporal: and therefore as all which is eternal, although it were little in it ſelf ought to be eſteemed as infinite, ſo all which is temporal, although it were infinite, yet is to be eſteemed as nothing, becauſe it is to end in nothing. If a man were Lord of infinite worlds, and poſſeſt infinite riches, if they were at laſt to end, and he to leave them, they were to be valued as nothing; and if all things temporal have this evil property to ſail and periſh, they ought to have no more eſteem, then if they were not. with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then is life it ſelf to be valued as nothing, ſince nothing is more frail, nothing more periſhing, and in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51068:46"/>concluſion is little more than if it had no being at all. Poſſeſſions, Inheritances, Riches, Titles, and other goods of fortune remain when man is gone, but not his Life. A little exceſs of cold or heat makes and end of that; a ſharp winde, the infectious breath of a ſick perſon, a drop of poiſon makes it vaniſh; in ſo much as no glaſs is ſo frail as it. Glaſs without violence may laſt long, but the life of man ends of it ſelf; glaſs may with care be preſerved for many ages, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can preſerve the life of man, it conſumes it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>All this was well underſtood by King <hi>David,</hi> who was the moſt powerful and happy Prince the Hebrews ever had, as ruling over both the Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> with all which was promiſed by God unto the Iſraelites, but not until his time poſſeſſed; his Dominions beſides extending over many other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">See <hi>1.</hi> Paralip. <hi>29.</hi> what he left him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple onely.</note> ſo as gold rowld up and down his Houſe and Court, and he left at his death mighty treaſures unto his Son <hi>Salomon.</hi> Yet this ſo fortunate a Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that his greatneſs was to have an end, valued it as nothing, and not onely eſteemed his Kingdoms and treaſures as a vanity, but even his life it ſelf Wherefore he ſayes, <hi>Thou haſt put, O Lord, a meaſure unto my dayes, and my ſubſtance is as nothing;</hi> all my Rents, all my Kingdoms, all my Trophies, all my Treaſures, all which I poſſeſs, although ſo powerful a King, all is nothing: And preſently adds, Doubtleſs <hi>all is vanity all what living man is,</hi>

Of ſo mean value are the things of this world although we were to enjoy them for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but being to end ſo quickly, and perhaps more ſodainly than we can imagine, what account is to be made of them? O if we could but frame a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the ſhortneſs of this life, how ſhould we deſpiſe the pleaſures of it? This is a matter of ſuch importance, that God commanded the principal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51068:47"/>his Prophets, that he ſhould goe into the Streets and Market-places, and proclaim aloud, How frail and ſhort was the life of man. For the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to propheſie of the moſt high and hidden myſterie, which ever God revealed unto man, which is the incarnation of the eternal Word, was ſuddenly commanded by the Lord to lift up his voice and <hi>to crie aloud:</hi> unto whom the Prophet replied, <hi>What is it O Lord that I muſt crie aloud?</hi> The Lord ſaid, That all <hi>fleſh is graſs, and all the glory of it, at the flowers of the field.</hi> For as the graſs, which is cut in the morning, withers before night, and as the flower is quickly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo is the life of all fleſh, the beauty and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of it paſſing and withering in a day. Upon which place ſaith St. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                     <q>He who ſhall look upon the frailty of our fleſh, and that every moment of an hour we increaſe and decreaſe without ever remaining in the ſame ſtate, and that even what we now ſpeak, dictate, or write, flyes away with ſome part of our life, will not doubt to ſay, his fleſh is graſs, and the glory of it as the flower of the field. And preſently after; He that was yeſterday an Infant is now a Boy, and will ſuddenly be a Youth, and even until old age runs changing through uncertain conditions of lite, and perceaves himſelf firſt to be an old man, before he begins to admire that he is not ſtill a Boy.</q> In another place the ſame Saint meditating upon the death of <hi>Nepotianus,</hi> who died in the flower of his age, breaks out into theſe complaints.<note place="margin">In Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot.</note> 
                     <q>O miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humane nature; Vain is all that we live without Chriſt: all fleſh is hay, and all the glory of it as the flower of the field. Where is now, that comely viſage? where is now the dignity of the whole body, with which as with a fair garment the beauty of the Soul was once cloathed? Ay pitty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lilly is withered by a Southern blaſt, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Violet turned into paleneſs. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adds, Why do we not therefore conſider
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51068:47"/>what in time muſt become of us, and what, will we or will not, cannot be far off? for ſhould our life exceed the terme of 900 years, and that the dayes <hi>Mathuſalam</hi> were beſtowed upon us, yet all this length of life once paſt (and paſs it muſt) were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and betwixt him who lives but ten years, and him who lives a thouſand, the end of life and the unavoidable neceſſity of death once come, all is the ſame, ſave onely he who lives longer, departs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier loaden with his ſins.</q> This frailty therefore and brevity of humane life being ſo certain and evident, yet our Lord would have his Prophet publiſh it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the moſt hidden and unknown myſterie of his incarnation, and the manner of the worlds redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which even the moſt high Scraphins did not conceive poſſible; and all becauſe men will not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded of this truth, nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally apprehend the ſhortneſs of their life: Nay ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death ſeiſeth upon others, yet they will not believe that it ſhall happen unto themſelves; and although they hear of it hourly, yet it appears unto them as a hidden myſterie, which they cannot underſtand. God therefore commanded the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he ſhould proclaim and publiſh it with a loud voice, as a thing new and of great importance, that it might ſo penetrate and link into the hearts of men. Let us therefore receive this truth from God himſelf: All fleſh is graſs, All age is ſhort, All time flyes, All life vaniſhes, and a great multitude of years are but a great nothing.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo hear how true this is from thoſe who lived the longeſt,<note place="margin">Jux. Iſi. l. de vita &amp; mor. Pat. c. <hi>24.</hi>
                     </note> and have had the greateſt experience of what it is to live. Perhaps thou mayſt promiſe thy ſelf to live a hundred years, as though this were a long life: Hearken then unto holy <hi>Job,</hi> who lived 240 years, who knew beſt what it was to live, both in reſpect of his proſperity, and of his great troubles and afflictions, the which make life appear longer
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51068:48"/>than it is. What ſayes he of all his years? <hi>My dayes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are nothing.</hi> Nothing he calls them, although they laſted almoſt three ages. In other places ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſhortneſs of life, and declaring it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Compariſons and Metaphors, ſometimes he ſayes, His days were more ſpeedy than a Meſſenger, and that they paſſed as a Ship under ſail, or as an Eagle which ſtoops furiouſly upon his prey; ſometimes, that They were more ſwift than a Weavers Shuttle; in one place he compares his life unto a withered leaf, born up and down by the wind, or unto drie ſtubble; in another he ſayes, That the life of man is like the flower, which ſprings up to day, and to morrow is trodden under foot: and that it flies like a ſhadow, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the ſame ſtate. How poor a thing then is life, ſince holy <hi>Job</hi> calls it but a ſhadow, though then three or four times longer, than at preſent? And it is no marvel, ſince thoſe whoſe life exceeded nine hundred years, who lived before the deluge, and are now moſt of them in hell, complain as the Wiſe man relates it in this manner.<note place="margin">

                     <q>What hath our pride pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited us, or the pomp of our riches availed us? all thoſe things are paſſed as a ſhadow, or as a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who runs poſt, or as a ſhip, which breaks the unquiet waves, and leaves no track or path behinde it, or like the bird, which flies through the air, and leaves no ſigne after her, but with the noiſe of her wings beats the light wind, and forces her ſelf a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage without leaving any knowledge which way ſhe made her flight, or like the arrow ſhot at the mark, which hath ſcarce divided the ſubtil Element, when it cloſes and joyns again in ſuch manner as it cannot be perceived which way it went: Even ſo we were hardly born when upon a ſodain we ceaſed to be.</q> Theſe were the words even of thoſe who were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who lived more than 800 years: and if they eſteemed ſo long a life but as a ſhadow, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when they died judged they were ſcarce born;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51068:48"/>how canſt thou think to live long in a time, wherein it is much to reach the age of 60? A life then of 800 years being no more than the flirting up and down of a little Sparrow, the flight of an arrow, or, to ſay better, the paſſage of a ſhadow; what then are fifty years, unto which perhaps thou mayſt attain? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the longeſt tearm, whereunto humane life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, was compared by <hi>Homer</hi> but unto the leaves of a tree, which at moſt endure but a Summers ſeaſon. <hi>Euripides</hi> judged that too much, and ſaid that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicity was to be valued but as the length of a day. And <hi>Demetrius Phalareus</hi> allowed it hut a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpace. <hi>Plato</hi> thought it too much to give it any being at all, and therefore calls it but the dream of a waking man. And St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> yet leſſens that, calling it but a dream of thoſe who ſleep. It ſeems the Saints and Philoſophers could find no Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol, no compariſon ſufficient to expreſs the ſhortneſs of mans life, ſince neither a Curriere by land, nor a Ship by ſea, nor a Bird in the air paſſes with that ſpeed. All theſe things which we have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and others though eſteemed ſwift, yet have not ſuch equality of motion, but that they ſometimes ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their pace, and ſometimes ſtand ſtill. But the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous courſe of our life, by which it haſtens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, ſtops not ſo much as whilſt we ſleep; and therefore appeared unto <hi>Philemius</hi> ſo ſwift and rapid, that he ſaid this life was no more but to be borne and die, and that at our birth we iſſued forth of a dark Priſon, and at our death entred into a more ſad and dreadful Sepulcher. Quit from this ſhort life the time of ſleep, and thou quitteſt from it the third part: Take from it Infancy, and other accidents which hinder the ſeuſe and fruit of living, and there hardly remains the half of that nothing, which thou eſteemeſt ſo much. That which <hi>Averroes</hi> affirmed of Time, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Aver. <hi>4.</hi> Phy. tex. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> that Time was a being diminiſhed in it ſelf, may be well verified of Life, which is in it ſelf ſo little, as it is but a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51068:49"/>point in reſpect of Eternity; and yet ſo many parts are taken from that point. Beſides all this, doeſt thou think that this peece of life, which thou now enjoyeſt, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? thou deceiveſt thy ſelf. For as the Wiſe man ſays, Man does not know the day of his end; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as fiſhes, when they are moſt ſecure, are then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the angle, and birds with the ſnare, ſo death aſſails us in the evil time, when we leaſt think of it.</p>
                  <p>Confider then how vile are all things temporal, and how frail is all the glory of the world, being grounded upon ſo feeble a foundation: The goods of the earth can be no greater than is life, which gives them their value; and if that be ſo poor and ſhort, what ſhall they be?. what can the delights of man be, ſince his life is but a dream, a ſhadow, and as the twinkling of an eye? If the moſt long lite be ſo ſhort, what can be the pleaſure of that moment, by which is loſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs? what good can be of value which is ſuſtained by a life ſo contemptible and full of miſery? A figure of this was the Statue of <hi>Nebuchodonoſor,</hi> which although made of rich mettal, as of gold and ſilver, yet was founded upon feet of clay, ſo as a little ſtone falling upon it overthrew it unto the earth. All the greatneſs and riches of the world have for founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the life of him who enjoyes them, which is ſo frail and ſlippery, that not a little ſtone, but even the grain of a grape hath been able to ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. With reaſon did <hi>David</hi> ſay, that all which is living man is univerſal vanity: ſince the brevity of his lite ſuffices to vilifies and make vain all the goods which he is capable of enjoying. Vain are the honours, vain are the applauſes, the riches and pleaſures of life, which being it ſelf ſo ſhort and frail, makes all things vain which depend upon it, and ſo becomes it ſelf a vanity of vanities, and an univerſal vanity. What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wouldeſt thou make of a Tower founded upon a quick-ſand? or what ſafety wouldeſt thou hope for in a Ship bored with holes? certainly thou oughteſt to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51068:49"/>give no more eſteem unto the things of this world, ſince they are founded upon a thing ſo unſtable as this life. What can all humane glory be, ſince life, which ſuſtains it, hath (according to <hi>David</hi>) no more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence than ſmoke, or (according to <hi>St. Thomas</hi>) then a little vapour, which in a moment vaniſhes? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould endure a thouſand years, yet coming to an end, it were equal unto that which laſted but a day: For as well the felicity of a long as a ſhort life is but ſmoke and vanity, ſince they both paſs away and conclude in death. <hi>Guerricus</hi> the Dominican, a great Philoſopher and Phyſician, and afterwards a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divine, hearing them reade the ſift Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> wherein are recounted the Sons and Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of <hi>Adam</hi> in theſe terms, <hi>The whole life of Adam was</hi> 930 <hi>years, and he died; The life of his Son Seth was</hi> 912 <hi>years, and he died,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, began to think with himſelf, that if ſuch and ſo great men after ſo long a life ended in death, it was not ſate to loſe more time in this world, but ſo to ſecure his life, that loſing it here, he might find it hereafter; and with this thought entred into the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and became of a moſt religious life.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51068:50"/>betwixt the beholding of them for a 100, for 200 years, or much more incomparable. The other is, that he who lives long, and he who dies ſhortly loſe the ſame thing, being both deprived of the preſent, of which they onely are poſſeſt, and and no man loſes what he hath not.</q> So much from this wiſe Prince: why found no other ſubſtance in time, but onely this preſent moment.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.</note> And St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> informs us further of the being of this preſent moment, of which it cannot be affirmed ſo much as that it is at all. Theſe are his words. <q>If the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that it may be called time, is becauſe it is to paſs into the praeterit, how can it be ſaid to be, ſince the onely cauſe, why it is, is becauſe it ſhall not be? ſo as we cannot affirm it to have a being, but in as much as it is a way into a not being.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold then whereunto thou truſts thy felicity. See upon what pillar of braſs thou placeſt thy hopes; even on ſo ſlight a thing, that its whole exiſtence is in leaving to be, and receives its being (if it have any) from its paſſing into nothing. For what can that have, which is, and is not, ever leaving to be with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous fury, that thou art not able to detain it for one ſmall moment, ſince even during that moment it is in a perpetual motion? Let him, who is in the flower of his age, tell me by what power he is able to detain the years of his life but for one day: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can keep the pleaſure, which he now enjoyes, but one hour from leaving him. Let him endeavour to lay hold on time: But it is in vain; He knows not where to faſten: Time hath no ſubſtance, and yet runs with that violence, that it will ſooner hale thee after it, than thou ſhalt be able to keep it back. Wherefore the ſame holy Doctor ſpeaking of life, ſayes, That the time of life is a Careere unto death, the which is ſo ſwift and mixt with ſo many deaths, that he began to doubt, whether the life of mortals were to be called a life or death; and therefore thus
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51068:51"/>diſcourſes. <q>From the inſtant that we begin to be in this body,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>13.</hi> de Civ. ca. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note> which is to die, there is nothing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in it, but what brings on death. This is effected by the mutability of lite, if that may be called a lite, which onely works to bring on death: For there is none who is not nearer his death this year than the laſt, to day than yeſterday, now than a little while agoe: and all the time we live is ſubſtracted from the time of living, and every day that which remains becomes leſs and leſs; in ſo much as the time of this lite is nothing elſe, but a Careere unto death, in which no man is permitted to make ſtay or to march with more leaſure, but all are driven on with equal ſpeed.</q> Preſently after he adds: <q>For what elſe is daily and hourly done, until death which was ſtill a working be conſummated, and that time, which follows death, begin to be, which time was then in death whileſt there was a continual decay of lite? From hence it follows that man was never in lite whileſt he was in this body, which rather dies than lives: if perhaps he be not at the ſame time both in life and death joyntly: that is, in life which he lives untill that be ended, and in death which he dies, who is every moment deprived of ſome part of life. For the ſame reaſon <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaid: That we died every moment before the time of death was come.</q> And <hi>Seneca;</hi> 
                     <q>We erre when we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death, as upon a thing to ſucceed, ſince it hath both preceded, and is alſo to follow; for all what hath been before us is death. And what imports it, whether thou begin not at all, or end, ſince the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of both is not to be?</q> Every day we die, and every day we loſe ſome part of life, and in our very growth our life decreaſes and grows leſs, and this very day, wherein we live, we divide with death. Our lite in the book of <hi>wiſdom</hi> is compared unto the paſſing of a ſhadow, which, as it may be ſaid to be a kind of night, ſo our life may be called a kind
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51068:51"/>of death. For as the ſhadow hath ſome part of light, ſome of darkneſs, ſo our life hath ſome part of death, and ſome of life, untill it come to end in a pure and ſolid death. And ſince it is to end in a not being, it is very little to be regarded, eſpecially compared with eternity, which hath a being conſtant and for ever.</p>

                     <p>All (as hath been ſaid) which hath an end is little, ſince it is to end in nothing. Why therefore wilt thou loſe much for that which is ſo little, that which is true for what is falſe, and a ſubſtance for a dream? Hear what St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>20.</hi> ad Pop.</note> If for having a pleaſant dream onely for one night a man were to be tormented a hundred years when he were awake, who would deſire ſuch a dream? Far greater is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the truth of eternity and the dream of this life, betwixt the eternal years of the ether world, and the tranſitory ones of this. Leſs is this life in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the eternal, than an hours dream in reſpect of a hundred years awake; leſs than a drop in reſpect of the whole ſea. Forbear then ſome ſmall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure now, that thou mayſt not be deprived of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures hereafter; ſuffer rather ſome ſlight trouble at preſent, than be tormented hereafter tor all eternity. For, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, better is a little bitterneſs in the throat, than an eternal torment in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</p>
                     <p>All which paſſes in time Chriſt our Redeemer calls a very little. A very little did he call the time of his paſſion, and all thoſe bitter pains which he ſuffered in it; a very little that of the Martyrdome of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, endured with ſo many ſorts of torments: a little, a very little is all which in this life can be ſuffered in reſpect of eternal years.<note place="margin">Tract. <hi>10.</hi> in Jo.</note> 
                        <hi>Although,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>this little, becauſe we are yet in it, appears great,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51068:52"/>but when it ſhall be ended, then we ſhall perceive how ſmall and contemptible it is.</hi> Let us place our ſelves in the end of life: from that proſpect we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how ſmall are all things which now ſeem great unto us. Unto a moſt obſervant and religious Father of the Company of Jeſus, called <hi>Chriſtopher Caro,</hi> our Lord was pleaſed to give this leſſon, that he ſhould often conſider theſe two things, <hi>O how much,</hi> and <hi>O how little;</hi> That is, how much is eternity without end, how little is the time of this life; how much is God enjoyed for ever, how little the contents of this earth, which we are to leave behinde us; how much it is to raign with Chriſt, how little to ſerve our own appetite; how much is eternal glory, and how little to live long in this valley of tears. Wherefore <hi>Ecck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> ſaid, <hi>The number of the dayes of man, when many, are an hundred years, and are reputed as a drep of water, and as a grain of ſand. So ſew are our years in the day of eternity.</hi> Little will all time whatſoever appear to merit that which is eternal. With reaſon did St. <hi>Bernard</hi> often inculcate unto his Monks that ſaying of St. <hi>Hierome:</hi> No labour ought to appear hard, no torments long, by which is gained the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of eternity. Unto <hi>Jacob</hi> the ſeven years, which he ſerved <hi>Laban,</hi> ſeemed ſhort for the love he bare unto <hi>Rachel;</hi> why ſhould then the ſervice of God for a ſmall time ſeem long unto us? conſider whom thou ſerveſt, and wherefore: and mark whom <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for what. Thou ſerveſt the true God, and for eternal glory; he ſerved a deceitful Idolater for a frail and fading beauty.

Time paſt was that which was wound up, and roled upon the ſpindle: Time to come the Flax which remained to ſpin upon the Diſtaffe: and the preſent that which paſſed betwixt the fingers; for truely we know not to imploy our time in filling our hands with holy works, but ſuffer it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting to paſs through our fingers in matters of no ſubſtance or profit.

                        <hi>Our years did meditate,</hi> or as another lection hath it, <hi>Did exerciſ as the ſpiders;</hi> becauſe Spiders ſpin not wool, or flax, but the excrements of their own entrails, conſuming and diſſembowelling themſelves to weave a webb, which they work with their feet of ſo ſleight a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that in a moment it is rent in pieces; and ſo little profit, that it ſerves for no other uſe, than to catch flies. The life of man is full of vain labours, vexations of various thoughts, plots, ſuſpitions, fears and cares, in which it is wholly exerciſed and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, linking and weaving one care into another, ſtill troubling it ſelf with more, being ſcarcely freed from one employment, when it entangles it ſelf in another; and all ſo ill ordered and compoſed, as if they had been managed by feet inſtead of hands; ſtill adding labour unto labour, and toyl unto toyl, as the Spider does one thread unto another; firſt thinking how to obtain what we deſire, then how to keep it, after how to advance and encreaſe it, then how to defend it, and laſtly how to enjoy it: and yet in concluſion all falls to pieces in the handling, and becomes nothing.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51068:53"/>What labour doth it coſt the poor Spider to weave his webb, paſſing inceſſantly from one part unto another, and often returning unto the ſame place where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, conſuming himſelf with threads drawn from his proper entrails for the forming of his Pavilion, which with many journeys having placed on high, and at laſt finiſht this goodly artifice, one touch of a broom defaces and brings to ground all his labour. Juſt ſuch are the employments of humane life, of much toyl, and of little profit, robbing us of ſleep, and filling us with cares and anxieties, ſpending the moſt part of our time in uſeleſs projects and vain imaginations, which of themſelves fall to nothing, and in the end vaniſh without effect. For which reaſon <hi>David</hi> ſaid, Our lives meditated as the Spiders, who labour and toyl all day in making of Cobwebs; ſo the life of man paſſes in the continual cares and thoughts of what he is to be, what to endeavour, what to obtain, and all (as the Wiſe-man ſayes) is vanity of vanities, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of ſpirit; and for thoſe things, which concern the ſervice of God, we onely ſometimes afford them our thoughts, but ſeldom our works. With much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that the hope of our life yet to come was <hi>like the dream of one who watches.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> in the ſame manner calls the life paſt a <hi>dream of people awake.</hi> For in this both humane hope and life reſemble a dream, that neither of them have either being or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; and there is no man who after a diſcourſe within himſelf of his life paſt will not ſay, that dreams and truths are the ſame thing, ſince he poſſeſſes no more of what he once enjoyed, than of what he dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all his delights and pleaſures appearing ſo ſhort unto him, t hat their beginning and ending ſeem to be joyned together without a Medium.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> Time is the occaſion of Eternity: and how a Chriſtian ought to benefit himſelf by it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TIme, although ſhort, frail and ſlippery, yet hath one condition moſt precious, which is to be the occaſion of Eternity; ſince by it we gain that in a ſmall time, which we are to enjoy for ever. For this reaſon when st. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Time is at hand,</hi> the Gerek renders it, <hi>Occaſion is at hand,</hi> becauſe the time of this life is the occaſion of gaining Eternity, and that once paſt and overſlipt, there will be no remedy or hope left of obtaining the other. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to employ our time well, and not loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſo great a good, whoſe loſs is irrepairable, and will be lamented with eternal, but unprofitable complaints. Let us conſider how great is the good which occaſion brings along with it, and how the reſentment which is uſually cauſed by the loſs of it, that we may from thence know how to profit our ſelves by temporal occaſions in order unto eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and that we may be freed from that inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable and fruitleſs repentance of the damned, who have made no uſe of it. It is a great buſineſs this of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and depends wholly upon the ſwift time of this life, which once paſt is irrevocable, and the end of it moſt uncertain: and therefore we ought with a hundred eyes to watch occaſion that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs us not, and with a hundred hands to lay hold on it. The Ancients knowing the importance of it, feigned it to be a Goddeſs, thereby to declare the great good (when timely apprehended) which it brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankind,<note place="margin">In Epig. Graec.</note> whoſe Image they adored in this myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous figure. They placed it upon a Wheel, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

                     <hi>Auſonius,</hi> to ſignifie the effect which it leaves with thoſe who ſuffer it to ſlip from them, adds that it drew behind it <hi>Metanaea,</hi> that is Repentance, which onely remains with thoſe who know not how to uſe it.<note place="margin">Vide Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.

Wherefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with much reaſon calls Occaſion precipitate, becauſe it runs with as great violence, as he falls, who throws himſelf headlong from a high rock. Let us place in the middeſt of Eternity the longeſt time of humane life; let it be a hundred, two hundred, or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, as long as the lite of man before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; yet it will then appear but as an inſtant, and he who ſhall caſt his eyes upon the immenſity of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration, will remain aſtoniſhed that a thing ſo ſhort, ſo ſmall, ſo precipitate ſhould be the occaſion of that, which is ſo long, ſo great and ſo ſtable. Since therefore the whole time of this life is ſo ſhort for the gaining of Eternity, let us reſolve not to loſe it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince we have no aſſurance how long it will laſt: and although we were certain to live yet a hundred years longer, we ought not to ſpare one moment from the gaining of Eternity. But being uncertain how long we are to live, and perhaps ſhall die to morrow, how can we be ſo careleſs, as to let the occaſion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our glory paſs, which hereafter will never be offered? If a skilful Workman were commanded by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51068:54"/>ſome great Prince, that upon pain of death he ſhould have in readineſs ſome excellent piece of his work againſt ſuch a time as it ſhould be called for, and that although a years time were requiſite to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, yet it might perhaps be called for ſooner, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Artiſt would with all ſpeed finiſh the piece, the neglect being no leſs than the forfeit of his life. Since then our life eternal conſiſts in being furniſhed with the grace of God, and in preſerving his divine Image engraven in our ſouls, how can we be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to let paſs the occaſion of our ſalvation?</p>

The Sons-in-law of <hi>Loth</hi> when they ſaw they might have eſcaped the fire, and that being invited they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and laughed at the counſel of their Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, when afterwards they perceived it to rain fire and ſulphur upon them and their Cities, what grief and vexation had they for refuſing the benefit of ſo fair an occaſion offered at their own doors? O what ſorrow, what pain, what madneſs, what deſperation ſhall ſeiſe upon a damned creature, when he ſhall call to mind how often he hath been invited by Chriſt to ſalvation, and ſhall now feel a tempeſt of fire and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur pouring down upon him for ever in hell? King <hi>Hannon</hi> who had ſo good an occaſion to preſerve that peace whereunto he was intreated and invited by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when after he ſaw his Cities ruin'd, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants burnt like bricks in a furnace, ſome thraſht to death, others torn in pieces, what would he have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to have made uſe in time of ſo fair an offer, or of holding friendſhip with ſo great a King? but what is this in reſpect of what a ſinner ſhall feel, when he ſhall ſee himſelf burnt in hell fire, become an eternal enemy of the King of Heaven, and deprived tor ever of raigning with his bleſſed Saints? what deſpite, what grief of heart ſhall he then have? The evil Theef who was crucified with the Saviour of the world, what doth he now endure for refuſing that good occaſion which his companion embraced? what a repentance hath now the rich Glutton for not laying hold of ſo great an opportunity offered him at his own home, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> his demanding an alms from him, by giving of which he might have redeemed his fins? but he let it paſs, being more inhumane than his dogs,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51068:56"/>who ſuffered not the poor Leper to depart without firſt licking of his ſores, uſiug mercy with him, with whom their Maſter uſed none. What will he now ſay when all things have failed him, even one drop of cold water to cool his ſcorched and inflamed tongue, and all for denying ſo poor an alms as the crums which fell from his Table? What madneſs, what ſpite, what deſpair do now torment him for refuſing, when time was, ſo eaſie a means to gain his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>wherefore although it be true that the whole time of our life is an occaſion of obtaining eternal glory, yet in the paſſage of life there are ſome particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſucceſſes, upon which our ſalvation doth more eſpecially depend, by which we do either diſoblige God Almighty by rejecting them, or by embracing them oblige him (if I may ſo ſay) to favour us. Such a one was that of holy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who rather than he would offend his Creator, fled from his wanton Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and left his Garment in her hands. This was an excellent act, by which he much obliged God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and deſerved to receive thoſe favours which were after beſtowed upon him. In the ſame manner <hi>Suſanna</hi> layd hold on a great occaſion for the ſaving of her ſoul, when ſhe choſe rather to die, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the filthy pleaſure, whereunto ſhe was invited by thoſe wicked Elders. No opportunity ought to paſs us without ſhewing our ſelves quick and active in laying hold of it, greedy of pleaſing God Almighty, obliging him by ſome brave and heroical act, with which occaſion ſhall preſent us.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51068:57"/>and performing moſt heroical actions, which if made good uſe of, do much aſſure our ſalvation. Wherefore it is by ſome placed amongſt the ſignes of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have performed ſome great and noble action of vertue. Let us ſee what benefit ſome have made of occaſion in temporal buſineſſes, that we may not be leſs careful and ſollicitous in matters eternal. <hi>Rachel</hi> with what diligence did ſhe run to hide and cover the Idols which ſhe had ſtoln from her Father? with what diligence did <hi>Abigail</hi> goe forth to meet <hi>David,</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing whereby ſhe might appeaſe his fury? and certainly it ſhe had protracted never ſo little time, ſhe had run into evident danger of loſing the lives of her Self, her Husband, and Family.

Pitty it is that any occaſion ſhould ſlip from us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out benefit; a lamentable miſery that our lives ſhould paſs away in the things of the earth without ſeeking after thoſe of heaven, mans life being ſo ſhort and narrow for the meriting of a thing ſo long and infinite as are the joyes of eternity. With reaſon did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle admoniſh us: <hi>This I ſay unto you bretheren, Time is ſhort; that which remains is, that thoſe who have wives be as if they had them not, and thoſe who weep as if they did not weep, and thoſe who rejoyce as if they rejoyced not, and thoſe who buy as if they poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not, and thoſe which uſe this world as if they uſed it not, becauſe the figure of this world paſſes.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle conſidering the great ſhortneſs of time wills us ſo to ſettle our ſelves in the matters of our ſalvation and of the other life, that we remain in thoſe of this as ſtrangers, uſing them as if we uſed them not.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider then that if we ſuffer occaſion in the ſhort time of this life to over-ſlip us, that all hope of remedy will fail us in the next. It is not void of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which is feigned by the Ancients, That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> beſtowed upon a certain perſon a Veſſel fill'd with all ſorts of goods and bleſſings: who overjoyed with the greatneſs of the gift, which contained all that was to be wiſhed for, and impatient of enjoying them one by one, and every good in his proper time and ſeaſon, would needs have them all at once. Whereupon he haſtily and undiſcreetly opened the Veſſel; but they were no ſooner diſcovercel, but all flew into the air and vaniſhed, and for all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and haſte he was able to uſe in ſhutting it, he could retain none but Hope, which onely remained behind. But far otherwiſe is it with the occaſion of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51068:58"/>our ſalvation: which although it contains all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bleſſings, yet being ſuffercd to paſs, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not behind ſo much as hope, but in the place of it repentance, deſpair, and eternal ſorrow, and ſo much the more in that it happens by our own faults. when King <hi>Joas</hi> ſmote the ground thrice, and was told by the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> that if he had ſmitten it ſix or ſeaven times, he had ruin'd and utterly made an end of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> what grief and affliction did he conceive in his mind, that having had an occaſion of ſo much happineſs, he had not made uſe of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the misfortune chanced without his fault? But the miſerable damned in hell, when they ſhall perceive that by their own fault they have loſt the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo great bleſſings as are thoſe of heaven, it is incredible what grief and reſentment ſhall poſſeſs them.</p>

For as a Statue remains for many years and Ages firm, ſtable, and immoveable, without encreaſe or diminution, whileſt the Shadow is in continual motion, now greater, now leſſer: So is it with Time and Eternity. Eternity is firm, fixed, and immoveable, without receiving leſs or more. Time is ever moving and changing as the Shadow, which is great in the morning, leſs at mid-day, and towards night returns to its former greatneſs, every moment changing and moving from one ſide unto another.

                  <p>Moreover how great is the difference betwixt a Statua of Gold or Marble, and the Shadow? That is ſolid, and of a precious ſubſtance: and this hath no being or body. In the ſame manner the life eternal is moſt precious and of great concernment, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral vain and miſerable without ſubſtance. The Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hath no other being but to be a privation of the moſt excellent quality in nature, and of the moſt beautiful thing the world produces, which is the light of the Sun. In the ſame manner this life without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or being is a privation of our greateſt happineſs. Wherefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">

The which was confeſſed by a certain Cavalier called <hi>Rowland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hiſt. de. S. Dom.</note> who having been preſent at a Feaſt celebrated with great coſt and bravery to the high content and ſatisfaction of the invited Gueſts, at night when he returned home, cried out with much bitterneſs of ſpirit, Where is the Feaſt we had to day? where is the glory of it? how is this day paſt without leaving any tract behinde it? even ſo ſhall the reſt of this life paſs, without leaving any thing to ſuceed it, but eternal ſorrow. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſufficed to make him change his life, and the next day to enter into Religion. And as in a ſhadow all is obſcurity, ſo this life is full of darkneſs and deceit. Whereupon <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſaid, That men ſat in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death. Much are we deceived whileſt we live in this body of death, ſince this life, although ſhort, appears long unto us, and being miſerable, yet we are pleaſed and content with it: and being nothing, yet it ſeems as if it were all things; and there is not any danger which men undergoe not for the love they bear it, even unto the hazard of Eternity. Doubtleſs this is the moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial quality of temporal life, that having in it ſelf no truth or reality, yet it paints and ſets forth that falſe ware, which it hath, with much beauty and luſtre to our perdition. Wherefore <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> ſaid, That it was not onely a ſhadow of life, but alſo a ſhadow of ſmoak, which blindes and ſmuts, and is a thing ſo inconſtant and vain; which is alſo ſuitable to that of <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That his dayes vaniſhed like ſmoak and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51068:60"/>grew towards an end like a ſhadow;</hi> joyning together the ſhadow and ſmoak, two things the moſt vain of any in the world. Even <hi>Pindarus</hi> exaggerates it yet more, ſaying, That it was no ſhadow, but the dream of a ſhadow; and what is it elſe but to dream, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade ones ſelf that this life is long, and hope for proſperity in it? This certainly is the greateſt deceit which is put upon man, and the chief cauſe of all his evils, that he ſuffers not himſelf to be perſwaded what life is, and the ſhortneſs of it. For as the Shadow is nothing leſs than the Statua whole Shadow it is, yet appears like it, and is the figure of it: ſo although this life be moſt ſhort, and nothing leſs than eternity, yet it looks like it, and unto us it ſeems as if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. This is a moſt hurtful and coſtly coſenage. For if life ſhould appear what it is, and not lie unto us, we ſhould not put our truſt in it, nor make ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of thoſe goods and bleſſings, which it promiſes, which in themſelves are ſo deceitful and uncertain; but being as it is an image and a ſhadow, all which it propoſes unto us, is but feigned and diſſembled, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing great happineſs, when it is onely full of miſery and calamity, although diſguis'd in ſuch manner as we know them not. How contented goes the Bride unto her Marriage Bed, and yet within a ſhort time laments her unfortunate choice? with what guſt does the ambitious man enter upon his office, which is but a Seminary of future ſorrow and vexation? what joy doe thoſe riches bring along with them, which in the end are to be the death of the poſſeſſor? All is deceit, diſſimulation, falſhood and prejudice: and yet we like frantick people are not ſenſible of our miſchiefs. Unto how many infirmities is the body of a man expoſed? with what imaginations is he afflicted and deceived? with how many labours and toyls does he daily wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? with what thoughts and apprehenſions doth he torment himſelf? what dangers of ſoul and body doth he run into? what fopperies is he forced to behold?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51068:60"/>what injuries to ſuffer? what neceſſities and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Nay ſuch is our whole life, that it ſeemed unto St. <hi>Bernard</hi> little leſs evil than that of hell,<note place="margin">Sermo de aſcen. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the hope we have of heaven. Our Infancy is full of ignorance and fears, our Youth of ſins, our Age of ſorrow, and our whole life of dangers. There is none content with his condition, but he who will die whilſt he lives: in ſo much as life cannot be good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it muſt reſemble death. Finally, as the Shadow is in ſuch manner an image, as it repreſents all things to the contrary, ſo as he who ſhall place himſelf betwixt the Statua and the Shadow, ſhall perceive that that which is upon the right hand of the Statua, the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow repreſents upon the left, and what it has upon the left, the Shadow hath upon the right: ſo Time is in ſuch manner the Image of Eternity, as it has all its properties to the contrary. Eternity hath no end: but Life and Time have a ſpeedy one. Eternity hath no change: but nothing is more mutable than Time. Eternity ſuffers no compariſon by reaſon of its infinite greatneſs: but Life and all the goods of it are ſhort and little, and derived from the earth, which is but a point.</p>

Let us begin with the firſt; Which is to be limited and ſubject to an end. In the which two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, The End, and the Manner of it, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is of more miſery than the end it ſelf. And truly although the end of life ſhould fall under humane ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that it were in the power of Man to make choice how many years he would continue in life, and after what manner he would then leave it, and that it might conclude ſome other way than by death or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet the conſideration, that it, and all things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral were to periſh, and at laſt to have an end, were ſufficient to make us deſpiſe it, and that very thought would drown all the pleaſures and contents which it could afford us. For as all things are of greater or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51068:61"/>leſſer eſteem according to the length and ſhortneſs of their duration, ſo life being to end, be it in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever, is much to be diſvalued. A fair Veſſel of Chryſtal, if it were as conſiſtent and durable as Gold, were more precious than Gold it ſelf: but being frail and ſubject to break, it loſes its eſtimation; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of it ſelf it might laſt long, yet being capable by ſome careleſs miſchance of being broken, it becomes of much leſs value. In the ſame manner our life which is much more frail than glaſs, being ſubject to periſh by a thouſand accidents, and though none of them ſhould happen, could not long continue, ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it ſelf, muſt needs together with thoſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods which attend it, be moſt contemptible. But conſidering that the ending of it is by the way of death, infirmities, and misfortunes, which are the Harbingers, and prepare the way for death, it is to be admired that Man, who knows he is to die, makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of temporal felicity, ſeeing the miſery, in which the proſperity of this world, and the Majeſty of the greateſt Monarchs are at laſt to finiſh. Wherein end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Lord of ſo many Provinces,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> 9.</note> but in a diſconſolate and mortal Melancholy: in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual waking, which with want of ſleep bereft him of his judgment; in a grievous torture in his belly, which forced him to void his very entrails; in a perpetual pain in his bones, that he was not able to move? And he who ſeemed to command the waves of the Sea, and that the higheſt mountains of the Earth hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his finger ends, whoſe Majeſty was once lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up above all humane power, could not then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf in his own Kingdom, nor move one pace from the place where they layd him: he, who cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in ſoft Silks, and pure Linnens, he whoſe Garments were more fragrant than the moſt precious ſpices, caſt now ſuch a ſmell from his putrified mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that none could endure his preſence; and being yet alive, his whole body ſwarmed with loathſome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51068:62"/>vermin, his fleſh dropped away by peeces, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all remained diſtracted in his wits, raging with deſpite and madneſs. Let us now conſider <hi>Antiochus</hi> in all his pomp and glory, glittering in Gold and daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the eyes of the beholders with the ſplendor of his Diamonds and precious Jewels, mounted upon a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courſer, commanding over numerous Armies, and making the very earth tremble under him. Let us then behold him in his Bed pale and wan, his ſtrength and ſpirits ſpent, his loathſome body flowing with worms and corruption, forſaken by his own people by reaſon of his peſtilential and poiſonous ſtink, which infected his whole Camp, and finally dying mad and in a rage. Who ſeeing ſuch a death would with the felicity of his life? who with the condition of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery would deſire his fortune? See then wherein the goods of this life conclude. And as the clear and ſweet waters of Jordan end in the filthy mud of the dead Sea, and are ſwallowed up in that noyſome Bitumen: ſo the greateſt ſplendor of this life concludes in death, and thoſe loathſome diſeaſes which uſually accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.<note place="margin">Act. <hi>12.</hi> Vide Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephum.</note> Behold in what a ſink of filth ended the two <hi>Herods,</hi> moſt potent Princes, <hi>Aſcalonita</hi> and <hi>Agrippa.</hi> This, who cloathed himſelf in Tiſſue, and boaſted a Majeſty above humane, dyed devoured by worms, which whilſt he yet lived fed upon his corrupted and apoſtumated fleſh, flowing with horrible filth and matter.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51068:62"/>birds and beaſts of prey, wanting in his death ſeaven foot of earth to cover him, who in life commanded a Kingdom. Who could have known <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had firſt ſeen him triumph over the Conquered world, and then beheld him gaſping for a little breath, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his own bloud, which flowed from three and twenty wounds opened by ſo many ſtabs? Who could believe it were the ſame <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he who ſubdued the <hi>Medes,</hi> conquered the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Empire, he who amazed the world with thirty years ſucceſs of continued Victories, now taken priſoner and put to an ignominious death by the Command of a Woman? Who could think it were the ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. in ejus vita.</note> who in ſo ſhort time ſubjugated the <hi>Perſians, Indians,</hi> and the beſt part of the known world, and ſhould after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him conquered by a Calenture, feeble, exhauſted in body, dejected in ſpirit, dried up and parched with thirſt, without taſte in his mouth, or content in his life, his eyes ſunk, his noſe ſharp, his tongue cleaving to his pallat, not being able to pronounce one word? What an amazement is it that the heat of a poor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould conſume the mightieſt power and fortune of the world: and that the greateſt of temporal and humane proſperities ſhould be drowned by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of one irregular and inordinate humour?</p>
                  <p>How great a Monſter is Humane Life ſince it conſiſts of ſo diſproportionable parts, the uncertain felicity of our whoſe life ending in a moſt certain miſery? How prodigious were that Monſter which ſhould have one arm of a Man, and the other of an Elephant, one foot of a Horſe, and the other of a Bear? Truly the parts of this life are not much more ſutable. Who would marry a woman though of a comely and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned body, who had the head of an ugly Dragon? certainly although ſhe had a great Dowry, none would covet ſuch a Bed-fellow. Wherefore then do we wed our ſelves unto this life, which although it ſeems to carry along with it much content and happineſs, yet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51068:63"/>is in effect no leſs a Monſter: ſince although the body appear unto us beautiful and pleaſant, yet the end of it is horrible and full of miſery? And therefore a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid well, that the end of things was their head: and as men were to be known and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their faces, ſo things by their ends; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who will know what life is, let him look upon the end. And what end of life is not full of miſery? Let no man flatter himſelf with the vigour of his health, with the abundance of his riches, with the ſplendor of his authority, with the greatneſs of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: for by how much he is more fortunate, by ſo much ſhall he be more miſerable; ſince his whole life is to end in miſery. Wherefore <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> hearing the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> cried up for a moſt fortunate and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince, reprehended thoſe who extolled him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Have patience;<note place="margin">Plutar. in ejus vita.</note> for even King <hi>Priamus,</hi> whoſe end was ſo lamentable, was not unfortunate at the age of the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> Giving us to underſtand that the moſt happy were not to be envied, whileſt they lived, by reaſon of the uncertainty of that end whereunto they are ſubject. How many as yet appear moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whoſe death will ſhortly diſcover the infelicity of their lives?<note place="margin">Plutar. in Apoph. Graecis.</note> 
                     <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> when they asked him who was the greateſt Captain, <hi>Cabrias, Iphicrates,</hi> or himſelf, Anſwered, that whileſt they lived no man could judge, but that the laſt day of their lives would deliver the Sentence, and give each one their due. Let no man be deceived in beholding the proſperity of a rich man; let him not meaſure his felicity by what he ſees at preſent, but by the end, wherein he ſhall conclude: not by the ſumptuouſneſs of his Palaces, not by the multitude of his Servants, not by the bravery of his Apparel, not by the luſtre of his Dignity; but let him expect the end of that which he ſo much admires, and he ſhall then perceive him at beſt to die in his Bed, dejected, diſmayed, and ſtrugling with the pangs and anxieties of death; and if ſo he comes off, Well; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

This reaſon tells us, although we had no experience of it. But we ſee it daily confirmed by the teſtimony of thoſe, who are already in the gates of death: and no man can better judge of life than he who ſtands with his back towards it. <hi>Mago,</hi>

                     <p>But let us forbear to look upon thoſe ſeveral kindes of death, which are incident to humane nature. Let us onely conſider that, which is eſteemed the moſt happy, when we die not ſuddenly or by violence, but by ſome infirmity, which leaſurely makes an end of us, or by a pure reſolution which naturally brings death along with it. What greater miſery of mans life than
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51068:64"/>this, that that death ſhould be accounted happy: not that it is ſo, but becauſe it is leſs miſerable than others? for what grief and ſorrow doth not he paſs, who dies in this manner? how do the accidents of his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties afflict him? The heat of his Fever which ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his entrails, The thirſt of his mouth which ſuffers him not to ſpeak, The pain of his head which hinders his attention, The ſadneſs and melancholy of his heart proceeding from the apprehenſion that he is to die, beſides other grievous accidents, which are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more in number than a humane body hath members to ſuffer, together with remedies which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no leſs painful than the evils themſelves. To this add the grief of leaving thoſe he loves beſt: and above all, the uncertainty whither he is to goe, to heaven or hell. And if onely the memory of death be ſaid to be bitter, what ſhall be the experience? <hi>Saul,</hi> who was a man of great courage, oncly becauſe it was told him that the next day he was to die, fell half dead upon the ground with fear. For what news can be more terrible unto a ſinner, than that he is to die, to leave all his pleaſure in death, and to give an account unto God for his life paſt? If lots were to be caſt, whether one ſhould have his fleſh pluckt off with burning pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or be made a King, with what fear and anxiety of mind would that man expect the iſſue? how then ſhall he look who in the agony of his death wraſtles with Eternity, and within two hours ſpace looks for glory or torments without end? What life can be counted happy, if that be happy which ends with ſo much miſery? If we will not believe this, let us ask him who is now paſſing the traunces of death, what his opinion is of life. Let us now enquire of him when he lies with his breaſt ſticking forth, his eyes ſunk, his feet dead, his knees cold, his viſage pale, his pulſes without motion, his breath ſhort, a Crucifix in one hand, and a Taper in the other, thoſe who aſſiſt at his death bidding him ſay, <hi>Jesus, Jeſus,</hi> and adviſing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51068:64"/>him to make an Act of Contrition, what will this man ſay his life was, but by how much more proſperous, by ſo much more vain, and that all his felicity was falſe and deceitful, ſince it came to conclude in ſuch a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od? what would he now take for all the honours of this world? Certainly I believe he would part with them at an eaſie rate. Nay, if they have been offenſive to God Almighty, he would give all in his power he had never enjoyed them, and would willingly change them all for one Confeſſion well made. <hi>Philip</hi> the third was of this mind, and would at that time have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed his being Monarch of all <hi>Spain,</hi> and Lord of ſo many Kingdomes in the four parts of the world for the Porters Keyes of ſome poor Monaſtery. Death is a great diſcoverer of truth. What thou wouldeſt then wiſh to have been, be now, whileſt it is in thy power. A fool thou art, if thou neglect it now when thou mayſt, and then wiſh it when it is too late. He who unto the hour of his death hath enjoyed all the delights the world can give him, at that hour what remains with him? Nothing; or, if any thing, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grief. And what of all his penances and labours ſuffered for Chriſt? Certainly, if he had endured more than all the Martyrs, he ſhall then feel no pain or grief of them all, but much comfort. Judge then if it ſhall not be better for thee to do that now, which thou ſhalt then know to have been the better. Conſider of how little ſubſtance all temporal things will appear, when thou ſhalt be in the light of eternal. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, which they have given thee, ſhall be no more thine: the pleaſures, wherein thou haſt delighted, can be no more thine: thy riches are to be anothers. See then whether the happineſs of this life, which is not ſo long as life it ſelf, be of that value, that for it we ſhould part with eternal felicity.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech thee ponder what is life, and what is death. Life is the paſſing of a ſhadow, ſhort, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and dangerous; a place, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51068:65"/>us in time for the deſerving of Eternity. Conſider with thy ſelf why God leads us about in the Circuit of this life, when he might at the firſt inſtant have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us in heaven. Was it perhaps that we ſhould here miſpend our time like beaſts, and wallow in the baſe pleaſures of our ſenſes, and daily invent new Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's of vain and frivolous honours? No certainly, it was not: but that by vertuous actions we might gain heaven, ſhew what we owe unto our Creator, and in the middeſt of the troubles and afflictions of this life diſcover how loyal and faithful we are unto our God. For this he placed us in the Liſts, that we ſhould take his part, and defend his honour; for this he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred us into this Militia and Warfare, (for, as <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, <hi>the life of man is a warfare upon earth,</hi>) that here we might fight for him, and in the middeſt of his and our Enemies ſhew how true and faithful we are unto him. Were it fit that a Souldier in the time of Battail ſhould ſtand diſarmed, paſſing away his time at Dice upon a Drum-head? and what laughter would that Roman Gladiator cauſe, who entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of Combat ſhould ſet him down upon the Arena and throw away his Arms? This does he who ſeeks his eaſe in this life, and ſets his affections upon the things of the earth, not endeavouring thoſe of heaven, nor thinking upon death, where he is to end. A Peregrination is this life; and what paſſenger is ſo beſotted with the pleaſures of the way, that he forgets the place whither he is to goe? How comeſt thou then to forget death, whither thou travelleſt with ſpeed, and canſt not, though thou deſireſt, reſt one ſmall minute by the way? For time, although againſt thy will, will draw thee along with it. The way of this life is not voluntary like that of Travellers, but neceſſary like that of condemned perſons from the priſon unto the place of execution. To death thou ſtandeſt condemned, whither thou art now going: how canſt thou laugh? A Malefactor after ſentence
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51068:65"/>paſt is ſo ſurpriſed with the apprehenſion of death, that he thinks of nothing but dying. We are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die; how come we then to rejoyce in thoſe things which we are to leave ſo ſodainly? Who being led to the Gallows could pleaſe himſelf in ſome little flower that was given him by the way, or play with the Halter which was ſhortly to ſtrangle him? Since then all of us, even from the inſtant we iſſue out of our Mothers wombs, walk condemned unto death, and know not whether we ſhall from thence paſs into hell, (at leaſt we may,) how come we to pleaſe our ſelves with the flower, or, to ſay better, with the hay, of ſome ſhort guſt of our appetites; ſince, according to the Prophet, all the glory of the fleſh is no more than a little hay, which quickly withers? How come we to delight in riches, which oftentimes haſten our deaths? Why conſider we not this, when we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all that we do in this life is vanity, except our preparation for death? In death, when as there is no time nor remedy left us, we ſhall too late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this truth, when as all the goods of this life ſhall leave us by neceſſity, which we will not now leave with merit.</p>
                     <p>Death is a general privation of all goods, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: an univerſal Pillager of all things, which even deſpoils the body of the ſoul. For this it is compared unto a Theef, who not onely robs us of our treaſure and ſubſtance, but bereaves us of our lives. Since therefore thou art to leave all, Why doeſt thou load thy ſelf in vain? What Merchant, knowing, that ſo ſoon as he arrived unto the Ports, his Ship and Goods ſhould both be ſunk, would charge his Veſſel with much Merchandiſe? Arriving at death thou, and all thou haſt, are to ſink and periſh: why doeſt thou then burthen thy ſelf with that which is not needful, but rather a hinderance to thy ſalvation? How many, forbearing to throw their Goods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board in ſome great Tempeſt, have therefore both
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51068:66"/>themſelves and Goods been ſwallowed by the raging Sea? How many who out of a wicked love to theſe Temporal riches have loſt themſelves in the hour of death, and will not then leave their wealth when their wealth leaves them, but even at that time buſie their thoughts more about it than their Salvation? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes, <hi>That is never loſt without grief, which is poſſeſt with love.</hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbertus</hi> writes of a certain man of great wealth, who falling deſperately ſick, and Plate of gold and ſilver to be brought before him: and in this manner ſpake unto his Soul; <q>My Soul all this I promiſe thee, and thou ſhalt enjoy it all, if thou wilt not now leave my Body; and greater things I will beſtow upon thee, rich Poſſeſſions and ſumptuous Houſes, upon condition thou wilt yet ſtay with me.</q> But finding his infirmity ſtill to encreaſe, and no hope left of life, in a great rage and fury he fell into theſe deſperate ſpeeches: <q>But ſince thou wilt not do what I deſire thee, nor abide with me, I recommend thee unto the Devil:</q> and immediately with theſe words miſerably expired. In this ſtory may be ſeen the vanity of Temporal things, and the hurt he receives by them, who poſſeſſes them with too much affection. What greater vanity then not to profit us in a paſſage of the greateſt neceſſity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? and what greater hurt then, when they cannot avail our bodies, to prejudice our ſouls? That they put an impediment to our ſalvation when our affections are too much ſet upon them, were a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motive not onely to contemn them, but alſo to deteſt them. <hi>Robertus de Licio</hi> writes, that whileſt he adviſed a ſick perſon to make his Confeſſion, and take care of his Soul, his Servants and other Domeſticks went up and down the houſe, laying hold every one of what they could; the ſick man taking notice of it, and attending more to what They ſtole from him, than to what He ſpake to him about the ſalvation of his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51068:66"/>Soul, made deep ſighs, and cried out, ſaying: Wo be to me, Wo be to me, who have taken ſo much pains to gather riches, and now am compelled to leave them, and they ſnatch them from me violently before my eyes. O my Riches! O my Moneys! O my Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els! into whoſe poſſeſſion are you to fall? and in theſe cries he gave up the ghoſt, making no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Soul, than if he had been a Turk. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Veluacenſis</hi> relates alſo of one,<note place="margin">Vincen. in ſpec. moral.</note> who having lent four pounds of money, upon condition, that at four years end they ſhould pay him twelve: he being in ſtate of death a Prieſt went to him, and exhorted him to confeſs his ſins, but could get no other words from the ſick perſon than theſe: Such a one is to pay me twelve pounds for four, and having ſaid this died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Much what to this purpoſe is a Story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by St. <hi>Bernardin</hi> of a certain Confeſſarius, who earneſtly perſwading a rich man at the time of his death to a confeſſion, could get no other words from him, but How ſells Wool? What price bears it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? and as the Prieſt ſpake unto him, Sir for Gods ſake leave off this diſcourſe, and have a care of your Soul, the Sick man ſtill perſevered to inform himſelf of ſuch things he might hope to gain by, asking him, Father, when will the Ships come? are they yet arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? for his thoughts were ſo wholly taken up with matters of gain and this world, that he could neither ſpeak nor think of any thing but what tended to his profit. But die Prieſt ſtill urging him to look to his Soul and confeſs, all he could get from him was, I cannot: and in this manner died without confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>This is the Salary which the goods of the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on thoſe who ſerve them, that if they do not leave or ruine them before their death, they are then certain at leaſt to leave them, and often hazard the ſalvation of thoſe that dote upon them. O fooliſh Sons of <hi>Adam!</hi> this ſhort life Is beſtowed upon us for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51068:67"/>gaining the goods of heaven, which are to laſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and we ſpend it in ſeeking thoſe of the earth, which are to periſh inſtantly. Wherefore do we not employ this ſhort time for the purchaſing eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince we are to poſſeſs no more hereafter than what we provide for here? Wherefore do we not conſider this? Wherefore buſie we our ſelves about Temporal things and the affairs of this life, which we are inſtantly to leave, and enter into a Region of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? Leſs are a thouſand years in reſpect of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than a quarter of an hour in reſpect of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years. Why are we then negligent in that ſhort time we are to live in acquiring that which is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a world of worlds? Death is a moment pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betwixt this life and the next, in which we are to traffick for eternity. Let us not therefore be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but let us remember how much it imports us to die well, and to that end let us endeavour to live well.</p>

The neareſt and moſt obliged Kindred procure it in all haſte to be carried forth a doors, and having wrapt it in ſome courſe Sheet throw it into the Grave, and within two dayes forget it: and he who in life could not be contained in great and ſumptuous Palaces, is now content with the narrow lodging of ſeaven foot of earth; he who uſed to reſt in rich and dainty Beds, hath for his Couch the hard ground, and, as <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaith, for his Mattreſs moths, and for his Covering Worms, his Pillows, at beſt, the bones of other dead perſons; then heaping upon him a little

                        <hi>Alexander Faya</hi> writes, that having opened the Vault, wherein lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred the Body of a principal Count, they who were preſent perceived upon the face of the dead perſon a Toad of an extraordinary greatneſs, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many other filthy and loathſome wormes and vermin, was feeding upon his fleſh: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great a horror and amazement, that they all fled; The which ſo ſoon as it came unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son of that Count, who was then in the flower of his age, he would needs goe and behold the ſpectacle: and looking ſeriouſly upon it he broke into theſe ſpeeches; <q>Theſe are the friends, which we breed and provide for with our delicacies; for theſe we reſt upon ſoft Beds, and lodge in gilt Chambers adorned with Tapeſtries, and make them grow and encreaſe with the vanity of our dainties. Were it not better to prevent them by Faſts, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51068:68"/>Penances, and Auſterities in our life, that they may not thus inſult upon us after death?</q> With this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration quitting his fair Poſſeſſions, and flying pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately away, accompanied onely with a lively deſire of being poor for Chriſt, which he accounted for the greateſt riches, he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where chaſtiſing the body with much rigour, and living in the holy fear of the Lord, he at laſt became a Collier, and by his labour ſuſtained his poor life. Finally, coming one day unto the City to ſell his coles, he fell into a grievous ſickneſs, which having endured with marvelous pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he at laſt delivered his moſt happy Soul into the hands of his Redeemer: and that very inſtant of his death all the Bells of the City rung themſelves; with which Miracle the Pope and the Roman Court being marvelouſly aſtoniſhed, his Confeſſor related unto them all that happened, and informed them both of the condition, and ſanctity of the dead perſon; and there being at the ſame time in <hi>Rome</hi> ſome Gentlemen and Souldiers belonging to the ſame Prince, who came in ſearch of their Maſter, and finding him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, carried home his holy Body with much joy and reverence unto his Country.</p>

Who ſees not here the vanity of the world? what is of more reſpect and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51068:68"/>eſteem than the Bodies of great Kings and Princes whileſt they live, and now dead the Guards and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which are to wait upon them flye from them? Who are accounted more happy than they who have the fortune to be near their perſons? They are ſpoken unto upon the knee as if they were Gods, but being dead all forſake them, and even Toads, Worms, and Dogs dare approach and eat them. A good teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this was Queen <hi>Jezabell,</hi> whoſe pamperd Body adored, whileſt ſhe lived, was being dead ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly torn in pieces by Dogs. But to return to our Story; The Marqueſs remaining alone behind the reſt, began to conſider what the Empreſs once was, and what he now beheld her. Where was the beauty of that face, but become worms and putrifaction: where that Majeſty and gravity of countenance, which made all reverence her, and thoſe people happy who beheld her, but now grown ſo hideous, that her moſt obliged Servants leave and abandon her? Where is now the Royal Scepter, but reſolved into filth and corruption? This conſideration ſo changed his heart, that deſpiſing what was temporal, and now wholly ſeeking what was eternal, he determined never after to ſerve that Lord who was mortal.</p>
                     <p>The very memory of the loathſomneſs of a dead Body may ſerve to make us deſpiſe the beauty of that which is living, as St. <hi>Peter Damian</hi> adviſes us,<note place="margin">Petrus Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in Gomor. c. <hi>23.</hi>

From hence ſpring all the errors of men, that they forget the end of their lives, which they ought to have ſtill before their eyes, and by it to order themſelves for the complyance with their obligations. With reaſon had the Brachmans their Sepulchers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſtill open before their doors, that by the memory of death they might learn to live. In this ſenſe is that Axiome of <hi>Plato</hi> moſt true, when he ſayes, That Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Meditation of Death: becauſe this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thought of Death undeceives us in the vanities of the world, and gives us force and vigour to better our lives.<note place="margin">Johannes Brom. in Sum. verb.

The ſame thing happened to another, who having confeſſed to to the Pope very hainous crimes, ſaid, that he could not faſt, nor wear hair-ſhirts, nor admit of any other kinds of auſterity.

For this reaſon it ſeems God commanded the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remias</hi> that he ſhould goe into the houſe of the Potter, and that he ſhould there hear his words. Well might the Lord have ſent his Prophet into ſome place more decent to receive his ſacred words, then where ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men were daily imployed in dirt and clay; but here was the particular myſterie, whereby we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to underſtand, that the preſence of Sepulchers, wherein is preſerved as in the houſe of a Potter the clay of humane nature, it was a place moſt proper for God to ſpeak unto us, that the memory of death might more deeply imprint his words in our hearts. For this very reaſon the Devil ſtrives with all his power and cunning to obſtruct in us the memory of death. For what other cauſe can be aſſigned why the meer ſuſpicion of ſome loſs or notable damage ſhould bereave us of our ſleep, and that the certainty of death, which of things terrible is moſt terrible, ſhould never trouble us?</p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:51068:70"/>Concerning the certainty and infallibility of death, it imports us much to perſwade our ſelves of it; for as it is infallible that the other life ſhall be without end; ſo it is as certain that this ſhall have it; And as the Damned are in deſpair to find an end in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo are we practically to deſpair that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and contents of this world are to endure for ever. God hath not made a Law more inviolable than that of death. For having often diſpenſed in other Laws, and by his omnipotent power and pleaſure violated, as I may ſay, divers times the rights of Nature, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath nor will diſpenſe with the Law of death, but hath rather diſpenſed with other Laws, that this ſhould ſtand in force; and therefore hath not onely executed the ſentence of death upon thoſe, who in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour ought to dye, but upon thoſe, unto whom it was no wiſe due. In the conception of Chriſt our Saviour thoſe eſtabliſht Lawes of Nature, that men were not to be born but by propagation from men, and breach of the Mothers integrity, were diſpenſed with. God, that his Lawes ſhould have no force in Chriſt, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two moſt ſtupendious Miracles, and infringing the Lawes of Nature, that his Son might be born of a Virgin Mother, was ſo far from exempting him from the Law of death, that death not belonging to him, as being Lord of the Law, and wanting all ſin, even original, by which was contracted death, nay immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and the four gifts of glory, being due unto his moſt Holy Body, as reſulting from the clear viſion of the Divine eſſence, which his Soul ever enjoyed, yet all this notwithſtanding God would not comply with this right of Nature, but rather miraculouſly ſuſpended by his omnipotent Arm thoſe gifts of glory from his Body, that he might become ſubject unto death; in ſo much as God obſerves this Law of Death with ſuch rigour, that doing Miracles that the Law of Nature ſhould not be kept in other things, he works Miracles, that the Law of Death ſhould be obſerved even by his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51068:70"/>own Son who deſerved it not, and unto whom it was in no ſort due. And now that the Son of God had taken upon him the redemption of Mankind, for whom out of his moſt infinite charity it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to dye the death of the Croſs, which reaſon failing in his moſt holy Mother, unto whom death was not likewiſe due from Original ſin, ſhe being privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, according to the opinion of moſt Univerſities, as well in that as many other things by her bleſſed Son, yet would he not exempt her from that inviolable Law of Death. What inchantment than is this, that, Death being ſo certain, we will not ſuffer our ſelves to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, nor be perſwaded that it is ſo? Thou art to dye: aſſure thy ſelf of that. An irrevocable Law is this, and without remedy: Thou muſt dye. The time will come, when thoſe eyes, with which thou readeſt this, ſhall be burſt and loſe their ſight: thoſe hands, which thou now imployeſt, be without ſenſe or motion: that body, which thou moveſt from place to place with ſuch agility, ſhall be ſtiffe and cold: this mouth, which now diſcourſes, ſhall be mute without breath or ſpirit: and this fleſh, which thou now pampereſt, ſhall be conſumed and eaten by loathſome worms and vermin. An infallible thing it is that the time will come, when thou ſhalt be covered with earth, thy body ſtink and rot, and appear more noyſome and more horrible unto the ſenſes than a dead Dog putrified upon a Dunghil. The time will come when thou ſhalt be forgotten as if thou hadſt never been, and thoſe that paſſe ſhall walk over thee without remembring that ſuch a man was born. Conſider this and perſwade thy ſelf that thou muſt dye as well as others; that which hath happened to ſo many muſt happen alſo unto thee; thou which art now afraid of the dead, muſt dye thy ſelf; thou which loatheſt to behold an open Sepulcher where lie the half putrified bones and fleſh of others, muſt putrifie and rot thy ſelf. Think upon this ſeriouſly, and reflect with thy ſelf ſoberly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51068:71"/>how thou ſhalt look, when thou art dead; and this conſideration will give thee a great knowledge what thy life is, and make thee deſpiſe the pleaſures of it.</p>
                  <p>Truly ſuch is the condition of death, that although to dye were onely contingent and no wiſe certain, yet, becauſe it might happen, it ought to make us very careful and ſollicitous. If God had at firſt created the world repleniſhed with people, and ſome one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was known what death was, had fallen ſick of a peſtilential Fever, and ſhould have ſuffered in the ſight of the reſt the accidents of that infirmity, thoſe violent fits of heat, that ſcorching thirſt, that reſtleſs unquietneſs of mind and body toſſing and tumbling from ſide to ſide, that raging frenzie which bereaves him of his judgment, and at laſt they ſhould behold him pale and wan, wholly disfigured, ſtrugling with death, and giving the laſt gaſp, the Body after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtiffe, cold, and immoveable, how would they remain aſtoniſht with the ſight of that miſery? which would appear much greater, when after three or four dayes the Body begun to ſmell and corrupt, to be full of worms and filth. Without doubt a mortal ſadneſs would ſeiſe upon them all, and every one would fear leſt ſome ſuch miſerable condition might happen unto himſelf. And although God ſhould ſay, I will not that all ſhall dye; I will content my ſelf with the death of ſome few, but ſhould leave thoſe uncertain, whom, this would ſuffice to make all to tremble: each one would fear leſt he were one of thoſe deſigned for that misfortune. If then in this caſe, death being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, all would quake; becauſe all might dye, why remain we ſo ſupinely careleſs, ſince it is ſure all muſt dye? If death being doubtful cauſe ſuch a terrour, why do we not fear it being certain? Nay though God ſhould further ſay, that onely one of all thoſe in the world ſhould dye, but did not declare who that one were, yet all would fear. Why then doeſt thou
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51068:71"/>not now fear, when all men muſt infallibly dye, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou the firſt? But if God ſhould yet further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reveal that one appointed to dye, and he ſhould notwithſtanding live in that looſe and careleſs manner as thou now doeſt, how would the reſt of the world admire his negligence, and vain temerity? what would they ſay? certainly they would cry out unto him, Man, thou that art to turn into duſt, why liveſt thou in that looſe man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Man, which art to appear before the Tribunal of God, why doeſt thou not think upon the account that ſhall be demanded from thee? Man, which art to end, and all things with thee, why doeſt thou make ſuch eſteem of vanity? We who are to live ever, well may we build houſes and provide riches, becauſe we look for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life than this, which is never to end; but thou who art but in this life as a Paſſenger, and art to leave it to morrow, what haſt thou to do to build houſes? what haſt thou to doe with the cares and buſineſs's of this world? Wherefore doeſt thou take thought for thoſe temporal things whereof thou haſt no need? Care for thoſe of the other life wherein thou art to remain for ever. Thou, thou art he whom God hath deſigned to dye, why doeſt thou not believe it? or if thou doeſt, why doeſt thou laugh? why doeſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? why doeſt thou live ſo much at eaſe in a place where thou art a Pilgrim and not to reſt? leave off the thoughts of the earth, and conſider whither thou art to goe. It is not fitting for thee to live here in mirth and jollity, but to retire into ſome ſolitary wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and there diſpoſe thy ſelf for that terrible traunce which expects thee.</p>
                  <p>Let every man therefore ſay within himſelf, It is I who am to dye and reſolve unto duſt; I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with this world; the other was made for me: and I am onely to care for that; in this I am onely a Paſſenger, and am therefore to look upon the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51068:72"/>eternal, whither I am going, and am there to make my abode for ever. Certain it is, that death will come and hurry me along with him. All the buſineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have now, is to diſpoſe my ſelf for ſo hard an encounter; and ſince it is not in the power of man to free me from it, I will onely ſerve that Lord who is able to ſave me in ſo certain and imminent a danger.

The Souldier chanced to fall into his laſt infirmity, which no ſooner came unto the knowledge of the Marqueſs, but he inſtantly came to viſit him, accompanied with divers expert Phyſicians, and having enquired of his health, and ſpoken many things unto him of much comfort and dearneſs, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to aſſiſt him in all things which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to his health or content, and wiſht him boldly to demand what might be uſeful or available for him aſſuring him it ſhould be granted without ſpare of coſt or trouble.

Wherefore I admoniſh you that you open your eyes in time, and let my error be a warning unto you, that you preſerve your ſelves from ſo notable a danger, and that you endeavour in this world to ſerve ſuch a Lord, as may not onely free you from theſe preſent perplexities, and preſerve you from future evils, but may be able to crown you with glory in another life.

                     <p>Let us now come unto the ſecond condition, which is the Uncertainty of time in the Circumſtances. For as it is moſt certain that we are to dye, ſo it is moſt uncertain How we are to dye: and as there is nothing more known than that death is to ſeiſe upon all, ſo there is nothing leſs underſtood than When, and in What manner. Who knows whether he is to dye in his old age, or in his youth? if by ſickneſs, or ſtruck by a Thunder-bolt? if by grief, or ſtabbed by Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards? if ſuddenly, or ſlowly? if in a City, or in a Wilderneſs? if a year hence, or to day? the doors of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51068:73"/>death are ever open, and the enemy continually lies in ambuſh, and when we leaſt think of him will aſſault us. How can a man be careleſs to provide for a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which ever threatens him? Let us ſee with what art men keep their temporal things, even at ſuch time as they run no hazard. The Shepheards guard their Flocks with watchful Dogs, although they believe the Wolf to be far off, onely becauſe he may come: And walled Towers are kept by Garriſons in time of peace, becauſe an enemy either has or may approach them. But when are we ſecure of death? when can we ſay that now it will not come? why do we not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our ſelves againſt ſo apparent danger? In fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns the Centinels watch day and night, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Enemy appears, nor any aſſault is feared; why do we not alwayes watch ſince we are never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the aſſaults of death? He who ſuſpected that Theeves were to enter his houſe, would wake all night, becauſe they ſhould at no hour find him unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. It being then not a ſuſpicion, but an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent certainty that death will come, and we know not when, why do we not alwayes watch? We are in a continual danger, and therefore ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared. It is good ever to have our Accompts made with God, ſince we know not but he may call us in ſuch haſte as we ſhall have no time to perfect them. It is good to play a ſure game, and be ever in the grace of God. Who would not tremble to hang over ſome vaſt precipice, wherein if he fell he were certain to be daſhed in a thouſand pieces, and that by ſo weak a ſupporter as a thread? This, or in truth much greater is the danger of him, who is in mortal ſin, who hangs over hell by the thread of life, a twiſt ſo delicate, that not a knife, but the wind and the leaſt fit of ſickneſs breaks it. Wonderful is the danger wherein he ſtands, who continues to the ſpace of one <hi>Ave Maria</hi> in mortal ſin. Death hath time enough to ſhoot his arrow in the ſpeaking a word, the twinkling
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51068:73"/>of an eye ſuffices. Who can laugh and be pleaſed whileſt he ſtands naked and diſarmed in the middeſt of his Enemies? Amongſt as many Enemies is man, as there are wayes to death, which are innumerable. The breaking of a vein in the body, The burſting of an Impoſthume in the entrails, A vapour which flyes up to the head, A paſſion which oppreſſes the heart, A tyle which falls from a houſe, A piercing air which enters by ſome narrow cranny, <hi>Vn yerro de cuenta,</hi> A hundred thouſand other occaſions open the doors unto death, and are his Miniſters. It is not then ſafe for man to be diſarmed and naked of the grace of God in the middeſt of ſo many adverſaries and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of death, which hourly threaten him. We iſſue from the wombs of our Mothers as condemned perſons out of priſon, and walk towards execution for the guilt which we have contracted by Original ſin. Who being led to execution would entertain himſelf by the way with vain conceipts and frivolous jeſts? we are all condemned perſons who go to the Gallows though by different wayes, which we our ſelves know not: Some the ſtraight way, and ſome-by by-paths, but are all ſure to meet in death. Who knows whether he goe the direct way, or windes about by turns? whether he ſhall arrive there ſoon or ſtay later? all that we know, is, that we are upon the way, and are not far from thence. We ought therefore ſtill to be prepared and free from the diſtracting pleaſures of this life for fear we fall ſuddenly and at unawares upon it. This danger of ſudden death is ſufficient to make us diſtaſte all the delights of the earth. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> that he might undeceive a young Philoſopher, who therefore held him to enjoy the chief felicity, becauſe he wanted nothing of his pleaſure, cauſed him one day to be placed at a Royal Table, and ſerved with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſplendid entertainments, but over the place, where he was ſeated, cauſed ſecretly a ſharp-pointed Sword to be hung directly over his head, ſuſtained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51068:74"/>by a horſes hair. This danger was ſufficient to make the poor Philoſopher to forbear his dinner, and not to reliſh one morſel of the Feaſt with pleaſure. Thou then who art no more ſecure of thy life than he, how canſt thou delight in the pleaſures of the world? he who every moment expects death, ought no moment to delight in life. This onely conſideration of death according to <hi>Ricardus</hi> was ſufficient to make us diſtaſte all the pleaſures of the earth. A great danger or fear ſuffices to take away the ſenſe of leſſer joyes; and what greater danger then that of Eternity?</p>
                     <p>Death is therefore uncertain, that thou ſhouldeſt be ever certain to deſpiſe this life, and diſpoſe thy ſelf for the other. Thou art every hour in danger of death to the end that thou ſhouldeſt be every hour prepared to leave life. What is death but the way unto eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? A great journey thou haſt to make; wherefore doeſt thou not provide in time, and the rather becauſe thou knoweſt not how ſoon thou mayeſt be forced to depart? The People of God, becauſe they knew not when they were to march, were for forty years which they remained in the Wilderneſs ever in a readineſs. Be thou then ever in a readineſs, ſince thou mayſt perhaps; depart to day. Conſider there is much to do in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; prepare thy ſelf whileſt thou haſt time, and do it well. For this many years were neceſſary; wherefore ſince thou knoweſt not whether thou ſhalt have one day allowed thee, why doeſt thou not this day begin to diſpoſe thy ſelf? If when thou makeſt a ſhort jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and haſt furniſhed and provided thy ſelf of all things fitting, yet thou commonly findeſt ſomething to be forgotten, how comes it to paſs that for ſo long a journey, as is the Region of Eternity, thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf ſufficiently provided, when thou haſt ſcarce begun to think of it? Who is there who does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have ſerved God faithfully two years before death ſhould take him? if then thou art not ſecure of one, why doeſt thou not begin? Truſt not in thy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51068:74"/>health or youth, for death ſteals treacherouſly upon us when we leaſt look for it; for according to the ſaying of Chriſt our Redeemer it will come in an hour when it is not thought on. And the Apoſtle ſaid, the day of the Lord would come like a theef in the night when none were aware of it, and when the Maſter of the houſe was in a profound ſleep. Promiſe not thy ſelf to morrow, for thou knoweſt not whether death will come to night. The day before the Children of Iſrael went forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how many of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, young Lords and Princes of Families, promiſed themſelves to doe great matters the next day, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps within a year after? yet none of them lived to ſee the morning. Wiſely did <hi>Meſſodamus,</hi> who, as <hi>Guido Bituricenſis</hi> writes, when one invited him forth the next day to dinner, anſwered, <q>My friend, why doeſt thou ſummon me for to morrow, ſince it is many years that I durſt not promiſe any thing for the day following? every hour I look for death; there is no truſt to be given to ſtrength of Body, youthful years, much riches, or humane hopes.</q> Hear what God ſayes to the Prophet <hi>Amos;</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51068:75"/>perſons of eminent Birth and Nobility, ſo richly clad and in ſo brave an Equipage, that they appeared as ſo many Princes; To theſe the Biſhop added an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen choſen out of his own Subjects; ſo that they paſſed through <hi>France</hi> 700 Gentlemen in company, moſt richly accoutred; and for the greater Pomp and Magnificence of the Embaſſage there went along with them 400 beautiful Ladies in ſumptuous habits, and adorned with moſt coſtly jewels; the Coaches which carried them were ſtudded with gold, and enchaſed with ſtones of value; Beſides all this were many Gifts and rich Garments of ineſtimable price, which they brought along with them for Preſents. But the very day that this glorious Embaſſage entred <hi>Paris,</hi> before they came at the place appointed for their entertainment, a Curriere arrived with the news of the death of the eſpouſed Prince. Such was the grief that ſtruck the heart of the French King with ſo unexpected a news, as he could neither give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Embaſſage, nor ſpeak with the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour or thoſe who accompanied him; and ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted moſt ſorrowful from <hi>Paris,</hi> and every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto his own home.

                     <p>Since then thou knoweſt not when thou art to dye, think thou muſt dye to day, and be ever prepared for that which may ever happen. Truſt in the mercies of God, and imploy them inceſſantly, but preſume not to deferre thy converſion for a moment. For who knows whether thou ſhalt ever from hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have time to invoke him, and having invoked him, whether thou ſhalt deſerve to be heard? Know that the mercy of God is not promiſed to thoſe, who therefore truſt in him that they may ſin with hope of pardon, but unto thoſe who fearing his Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ceaſe to offend him. wherefore St. <hi>Cregory</hi> ſays;

And where, I beſeech thee, is the fear of his juſtice, when know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou mayeſt dye to day thou deferreſt thy converſion for ſo many years, ſo as thy vices may be rather ſaid to leave thee, than thou them? Mark what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſayes; <q>Repentance in death is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous; for in the holy Scripture there is but one onely found, to wit the good Theef, who had true repentance in his end. There is one found, that none ſhould deſpair, and but one, that none ſhould preſume. For in a ſound man repentance is ſound, in an infirm man infirm, and in a dead man dead.</q> Many deal with God, as King <hi>Dionyſius</hi> did with the Statue of <hi>Apollo,</hi> from which when he took his Cloak of maſſie gold, he ſaid, This Cloak is good neither for Summer nor Winter; for Summer it is too heavy, for Winter too cold. So ſome can find no time for the ſervice of God Almighty; In youth they ſay, It is too early, and that we ought to allow that age its time of freedom and pleaſure: that when they are old they will ſeriouſly think of vertue and amendment of life: that the vigour of youth is not to he enfeebled with the auſterities of penance, which renders us infirm and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51068:76"/>uſeleſs the reſt of our ſucceeding lives; But arriving at old age, if by chance they attain it, they have then many excuſes, and pretend that they want health and ſtrength to perform their penances. After this manner they would deceive God Almighty, but they remain deceived themſelves. To the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> this manner of ſpeech ſeemed not well; To morrow we will goe to ſuch a City; and there we will ſtay a year, becauſe we know not what ſhall be to morrow. If then in temporal things it be not good to ſay, I will do this to morrow, what ſhall it be in procuring the ſalvation of our Souls, to ſay, Ten or twenty years hence, when I am old, (which who knows whether ever ſhall be?) I will then ſerve God and repent? to what purpoſe deferre we that untill tomorrow, which imports ſo much to be done to day, eſpecially ſince it abſolutely imports, and perhaps will not be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if not to day?<note place="margin">Aug.

                     <p>To this Uncertainty of death is to be added the Third Condition of being onely one, and onely once to be tryed; ſo as the error of dying ill cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by dying well another time. God gave unto Man his ſenſes and other parts of his body doubled; he gave him two eyes, that if one failed, he might ſerve himſelf of the other: he gave him two ears, that if one grew deaf, he might ſupply the defect by the other: he gave him two hands, that if one were loſt, yet he might not wholly be diſabled; but of deaths he gave but one, and if that one miſcarry, all is ruin'd.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51068:76"/>A terrible caſe, that the thing which moſt imports us, which is to dye, hath neither tryal, experience, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: it is but onely once to be acted, and that in an inſtant, and upon that inſtant all Eternity depends, in which if we fail, the error is never to be amended. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes of <hi>Lamachus</hi> the Centurion, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending a Souldier for ſome error committed in warre, the Souldier promiſed him he would do ſo no more; Unto whom the diſcreet Centurion replyed, Thou ſayeſt well, for in warre the miſchief which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the firſt error is ſo great, that thou canſt not erre twice. And if in warre you cannot erre twice, in death you ought not to erre once, the error being wholly irrepairable. If an ignorant Peaſant, who had never drawn a Bow, ſhould be commanded to ſhoot at at a mark far diſtant, upon condition that if he hit it, he ſhould be highly rewarded with many brave and rich gifts, but if he miſt it, and that at the firſt ſhoot, he ſhould be burnt alive, in what ſtreights would this poor man find himſelf? how perplexed, that he ſhould be forced upon a thing of that difficulty, wherein he had no skill, and that the failing ſhould coſt him ſo dear as his life, but eſpecially that it was only once to be eſſayed, without poſſibility of repairing the firſt fault by a ſecond trial? This is our caſe. I know not how we are ſo jocund; We have never dyed, we have no experience or skill in a thing of ſo great difficulty, we are onely once to dye, and in that all is at ſtake, either eternity of torments in hell, or of happineſs in heaven; how live we then ſo careleſs and forgetful of dying well, ſince for it we were born, and are but once to try it? This action is the moſt important of all our life, the which is to paſs in the preſence of God and Angels; upon it depends all eternity, and if miſt, without repair or amendment, Thoſe human actions which may be repeated, if one miſs, the other may hit, and that which is loſt in one may be regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another. If a rich Merchant has this year a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51068:77"/>Ship ſunk in the Ocean, another may arrive the next loaden with ſuch riches as may recompence the loſs of the former. And if a great Oratour miſcarry in his declamation and loſe his credit, he may with another recover it: but if we once fail in death, the loſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be reſtored. That which is but onely one is worthy of more care and eſteem, becauſe the loſs of it is irrepairable. Let us then value the time of this life, ſince there is no other given us wherein to gain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Let us eſteem that time wherein we may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice a precious death, or, to ſay better, both a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life and death, learning in life how to dye. It was well ſaid by a pious Doctor, If thoſe who are to execute ſome office, or perform ſome matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or if it be but of pleaſure, as to dance or play at Tennis, yet ſtudy firſt before they come to do it: why ſhould we not then ſtudy the art of dying, which to do well is an action more dfficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than all others? If a man were obliged to leap ſome great and deſperate leap, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if he performed it well he ſhould be made Maſter of a wealthy Kingdom, but if ill, he ſhould be chained to an Oar and made a perpetual Galley-ſlave, Without all doubt this man would uſe much diligence in preparing himſelf for ſo hazardous an undertaking, and would often practice before an action of ſo great conſequence, from which he expected ſo different for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. How far more different are thoſe which we expect from ſo great a leap as is that from life to death, ſince the Kingdoms of Earth compared with that of Heaven are traſh and rubbiſh, and the tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at an Oar in the Gallies, compared with Hell, a Glory? When the leap is great and dangerous, he who is to leap it uſes to fetch his Careere backwards, that he may leap further and with greater force. We therefore knowing the danger of the leap from life to death, that we may perform it better, ought to fetch our Careere far back even from the beginning of our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51068:77"/>ſhort life, and from our firſt uſe of reaſon, from which we ſhall know, that the life we live is mortal, that at the end of it we have a great debt to pay, and that we are to diſcharge both uſe and principal when we leaſt think of it. St. <hi>John Eleemoſynarius</hi> relates, that anciently when they crowned an Emperour, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Architects preſented him with ſome peeces of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Marble, wiſhing him to make choice of ſuch as beſt pleaſed him for his Sepulcher, giving him thereby to underſtand, that his Reign was to laſt ſo ſhort a time, that it was convenient for him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to begin his Tomb, that it might be finiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his life were ended: and that withal he could not govern well his Vaſſals, unleſs he firſt governed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the memory of death. The others preſent were alſo admoniſhed by this myſtery, that ſo ſoon as reaſon began to command and have Dominion in us, that it was then time to provide for death, and that in the preparation for our end conſiſted the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of life. <hi>A perfect life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Gregory, is the meditation of death:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Greg. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> and he enjoyes a perfect life, who imployes it in the ſtudy of death; he lives well who learns how to dye well; and he that knows not that, knows nothing: all Sciences beſides profit him but little. What did all that he had ſtudied, and all which he knew profit the great <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle?</hi> nothing; which he himſelf confeſt being near his death: For when his Diſciples beſought him, that having in his life time beſtowed upon them ſo many fair Leſſons and wiſe Sentences, he would leave them one at his death, This was his anſwer: I entred this life in poverty, I lived in miſery, and dye in ignorance of that which moſt imports me to know. He ſaid well, for he had never ſtudied how to dye. Many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples hath <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in thoſe Sciences which he knew, and many which follow his opinions, but many more who imitate him in the ignorance he had of death.</p>

                     <p>Let us husband Time, in which we may gain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which being once loſt, we ſhall loſe both the Time of this life, and the Eternity of the other. How many millions are now in Hell, who whileſt they were in this world diſpiſed time, and would now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer thouſands of years all the torments of the damned for the redemption but of one inſtant, in which they might by repentance recover the eternal life of glory, which is now loſt without remedy? and yet thou caſts away not onely inſtants, but hours, dayes, and years. Conſider what a damned perſon would give for ſome part of that time, which thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt; and take heed that thou hereafter, when there ſhall be no repair of that time which thou now ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly miſpendeſt, be not thy ſelf in the ſame grief and bitterneſs. O fools, as many as ſeek vain etertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to paſs away the time, as though time would ſtand ſtill, if they found not divertiſements to make it paſs. The time of this life flyes and over-runs thee, and thou layeſt not up for the other. Conſider how thou mayeſt by Time gain Eternity; look not then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the loſs of it as upon the loſs of Time, but of Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Time, as ſaith <hi>Nazienzen,</hi> is the Market or Fair of Eternity. Endeavour then, whileſt it laſts, to get a good bargain: for this life once paſt there is no more occaſion of traffick; the time appointed for ſtoring up is but ſhort, and the gain and profit is eternal. Hear what a Heathen teaches thee, who knew not this great good, that by Time might be purchaſed Eternity, and yet he ſayes in this manner, <q>Nature did not beſtow Time upon us with ſuch liberality,<note place="margin">Seneca Epiſt. <hi>118.</hi>

In it I ſhall receive a ſtrict charge of all the Divine benefits beſtowed upon me: and in it a judgment ſhall paſs upon me either for my ſalvation or damnation eternal. How wonderful is it that for ſo many matters, and of ſo great importance, there is no more time allotted than the ſpace of an inſtant, no place left for reply, interceſſion of friends, or appeal. O fearful moment, upon which ſo much depends! O moſt important inſtant of Time and Eternity! Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the high wiſdom of God, which hath placed a point in the middeſt betwixt Time and Eternity, unto which all the time of this life is to relate, and upon which the whole Eternity of the other is to depend. O moment, which art neither Time nor Eternity, but art the Horizon of both, and divideſt things Temporal from Eternal! O narrow moment! O moſt dilated point, wherein ſo many things are to be concluded, ſo ſtrict an accompt is to be given, and where ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous a Sentence, as is to be pronounced, is ever to ſtand in force! A ſtrange caſe that a buſineſs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is to be reſolved in a moment, and no place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the interceſſion of friends, or our own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. It will be then in vain to repair unto the Saints in Heaven, or the Prieſts upon Earth; thoſe will not intercede for thee, nor can theſe give thee abſolution: becauſe the rigour of the Judge in that inſtant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou expireſt allows no further mercy.<note place="margin">Apoc. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes that Heaven and Earth ſhall flye from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Judge. Whither wilt thou then goe, to what place canſt thou repair, being the perſon againſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51068:80"/>whom the Proceſs is commenced? It is therefore ſaid that Heaven and Earth ſhall flye away, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints of Heaven ſhall there favour thee with their interceſſion, neither can the Prieſts of the Earth aſſiſt thee with the Sacraments of the Church. There ſhall be place for nothing that may help thee. What would then a ſinner give for leave to make one poor Confeſſion when it is too late? that which would now ſerve thy turn, and thou deſpiſeſt, thou wouldeſt then have done and canſt not. Provide thy ſelf therefore in time whileſt it may avail thee, and deferre it not until that inſtant, wherein nothing can do thee good. Now thou mayeſt help thy ſelf; now the Saints will favour thee; expect not that moment wherein thy own endeavours will be uſeleſs, and wherein the Saints will not aſſiſt thee. To the end we may frame a more lively conceit of what hath been ſaid,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> I will relate a Story, which St. <hi>Peter Damian</hi> rehearſeth in an Epiſtle of his to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond of that name: whereof the Saint ſayes, it cauſed dread in him as often as it came to his mind. Thus it was, That two men going to fell wood in a Foreſt, there iſſued forth a Serpent, ugly and of a huge ſize, with two heads, and mouths of both open, thruſting out their tongues with three points or ſmall darts in each of them, and ſeeming to caſt out fire at his eyes ſet upon them. One of the two men of more ſpirit and courage, at the firſt aſſault of the Serpent, ſtruck it with his hatchet, and cut off one of his heads: but unfortunately let fall his hatchet. The Serpent feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf wounded, full of fury and rage, took him at the diſadvantage without his weapon, and roled his train round about his body. The miſerable man cried out to his Companion for help, or at leaſt that he would give him his hatchet to defend himſelf, or do ſome execution upon his enemy, that was now dragging him towards his Den. But his Companion was ſo cowardly, that he durſt not any wayes ſuccour
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51068:80"/>him, but affrighted and aſtoniſhed fled away, leaving that wretched man in the power of the Serpent, which with great rage carried him to his Den without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or any ſuccour at all, notwithſtanding the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous out-cries and lamentations the poor Captive made. This Hiſtory is but a ſlight draught of what a Sinner will experience in the inſtant of the departure of his Soul out of this life, when without any aid at all, or hope of it, he ſhall find himſelf at the mercy of the infernal Dragon, who will uſe him with all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence imaginable. St. <hi>Peter Damianus</hi> ſayes, he could not expreſs the horror this ſad accident cauſed in him, inſomuch that it made him tremble many times to conſider what paſs'd betwixt the Serpent and the man in that Den: there being no body to afford any help to the poor fellow in that diſtreſs, where neither his ſtrength, nor cries could any wayes avail him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the fury of that ugly Monſter now ready to tear him in pieces. Wherefore if to be void of all hopes of temporal life, and to be in the power of a Serpent is a thing ſo dreadful, what fright and aſtoniſhment will it cauſe, when a Sinner in the inſtant of Gods judgment ſhall ſee himſelf delivered over into the power of the infernal Dragon without all hopes of ever eſcaping from him, who will ſeize upon a Soul, and carry her to the abyſs of hell? Let us call to mind with dread that which the holy Prophet feared and ſaid of the Devil: <hi>God grant he lay not hold on my ſoul like a Lion, when there will be none that will ſet me at liberty, or relieve me.</hi> O what a lamentable thing will it be for one to ſee himſelf in the power of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> not onely abandoned by Men, but alſo by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and by the Queen of Men and Angels, and even of God himſelf Father of all mercies! Let us provide our ſelves in time for that which is to be done in a moment, on which depends our Eternity. O moment, in which all time is loſt, if a Soul doth loſe it ſelf in it, and remains loſt for ever, how much doeſt thou avail
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51068:81"/>us! Thou giveſt an aſſurance to all the good works of this life, and cauſeſt an oblivion of all the pleaſures and delights thereof, to the end that Man may not wholly give himſelf over to them, ſince they will then be of no benefit to him: and perſevere in vertue, ſince it will not ſecure him, unleſs he perſevere in it to the laſt.</p>

                     <p>How can men be careleſs ſeeing ſo important a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, as is the ſalvation of their Souls, to depend upon an inſtant, wherein no new diligence nor preparations will avail them? Since therefore we know not when that moment will be, let us not be any moment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided; this is a buſineſs not to be one point of time neglected, ſince that point may be our damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What will a hundred years ſpent with great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and auſterity in the ſervice of God profit us, if in the end of all thoſe years we ſhall commit ſome grievous ſin, and death ſhall ſeiſe upon us before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Let no man ſecure himſelf in his paſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but continue them until the end; ſince if he die not in grace all is loſt, and if he doe, what matters it to have lived a thouſand years in the greateſt troubles and afflictions this world could lay upon him? O moment, in which the juſt ſhall forget all his labours, and ſhall reſt aſſured of all his vertues! O moment, in which the pains of a Sinner begin, and all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures end! O moment, which art certain to be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain when to be, and moſt certain never to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for thou art onely once, and what is in thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, can never be revoked in another moment! O moment, how worthy art thou to be now fixed in our memory,<note place="margin">In vit. PP. l. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>565.</hi> apud Rot,</note> that we may not hereafter meet thee to our eternal mine and perdition! Let us imitate the <hi>Abbot Elias,</hi> who was accuſtomed to ſay, That three things eſpecially made him tremble; The firſt, when
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51068:81"/>his Soul was to be pluckt out of his Body; the ſecond, when it was to appear before God to receive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the third, when ſentence was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. How terrible then is this moment, wherein all theſe three things ſo terrible are to paſs? Let a Chriſtian often whileſt he lives place himſelf in that inſtant; from whence let him behold on one part the time of his life which he is to leave, and on the other the eternity whereunto he enters: and let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what remains unto him of that, and what he hopes for in this. How ſhort in that point of death did thoſe near-hand a thouſand years, which <hi>Mathuſala</hi> lived, appear unto him, and how long one day in Eternity? In that inſtant a thouſand years of life ſhall appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sinner no more than one hour, and one hour of torments ſhall appear a thouſand years. Behold thy life from this Watch-tower, from this Horizon, and meaſure it with the eternal, and thou ſhalt find it to be of no bulk, nor extenſion. Sec how little of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in thy hands, and that there is no eſcaping from the hands of Eternity. O dreadful moment which cuts off the thread of Time, and begins the web of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! let us in time provide for this moment, that we may not loſe Eternity. This is that precious pearl for which we ought to give all that we have or are. Let it ever be in our memory, let us ever be ſollicitous of it, ſince it may every day come upon us. Eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon death, death upon life, and life upon a thread, which may either be broken, cut, or burnt, and that even when we moſt hope and moſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prolong it. A good teſtimony of this is that which <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> recounts of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>

Upon a natural thread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the life of this Prince, which concluded in ſo diſaſtrous a death; and no doubt but the thread of life is as eaſily cut as that of flax; time is required for the one, but the other is broken in an inſtant; and there are more cauſes of ending our life, than are of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmalleſt twiſt.

                  <p>DEath becauſe it is the end of life is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid to be <hi>the moſt terrible of all things terrible.</hi> What would he have ſaid, if he had known it to be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51068:83"/>the beginning of Eternity, and the gate through which we enter into that vaſt Abyſs, no man knowing upon what ſide he ſhall fall into that profound and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depth? If death be terrible for ending the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affairs of life, what is it for uſhering in that inſtant, wherein we are to give an accompt of life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that terrible and moſt juſt Judge, who therefore dyed that we might uſe it well? It is not the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible part of death to leave the life of this world, but to give an accompt of it unto the Creatour of the world; eſpecially in ſuch a time wherein he is to uſe no mercy. This is a thing ſo terrible that it made holy <hi>Job</hi> to tremble, notwithſtanding he had ſo good an accompt to make, who was ſo juſt, that God himſelf gloried in having ſuch a Servant. The Holy Ghoſt teſtifies that he ſinned not in all what he had ſpoken in his troubles and calamities, which were ſent him not as a puniſhment for his ſins, but as a trial of his patience, propoſing him unto us an example of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and conſtancy; and he himſelf proteſts that his Conſcience did not accuſe him; yet for all this was ſo fearful of the ſtrict judgment which God paſſes in the end of the world, that amazed at the ſeverity of his Divine Juſtice, he cries out in his diſcourſe with the Lord, <hi>Who will give me, that thou protect and hide me in hell,</hi>

                     <hi>whileſt thy fury paſſes?</hi> Whereupon <hi>Dionyſius Rikellius</hi> affirms, that that inſtant, wherein the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is to be given, is not onely more terrible than death, but more terrible than to ſuffer the pains of hell for ſome certain time, and this not onely unto thoſe who are to be damned, but even unto thoſe who are elected for heaven. Since therefore <hi>Job,</hi> being ſo juſt and holy, quaked at the apprehenſions of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgement, when it was yet far from him, and when we uſe not to be ſo ſenſible as of things at hand, without doubt when a Sinner ſhall in that inſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf to have diſpleaſed his Redeemer and Creatour, although but in ſmall faults, yet it will afflict
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51068:83"/>him more than the ſuffering of moſt great pains; for which St. <hi>Baſil</hi> judged that it was leſs to ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal torments,<note place="margin">Baſil. hom. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros.</note> than the confuſion of that day: and therefore pondering that reprehenſion given unto the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>Fool this night thy Soul ſhall be taken from thee.

                  <p>Death is terrible for many weighty reaſons, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſufficient to cauſe in us a mortal fear, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not the leaſt is the ſight of the offended Judge, who is not onely Judge but Party, and a moſt irrefragable Witneſs, in whoſe viſage ſhall then appear ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt the wicked, that <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> ſayes, he had rather ſuffer all manner of torments, than to behold the face of his angry Judge. And St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Chryſ. homi. <hi>24.</hi> in Math.</note> 
                     <q>It were better to be ſtruck with a thouſand Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, than to behold that countenance ſo meek and full of ſweetneſs eſtranged from us, and thoſe eyes of peace and mildneſs not enduring to behold us.</q> The only ſight of an Image of Chriſt crucified,<note place="margin">Rad. in opuſc. &amp; in annuis Societ.</note> which appeared with wrathful and incenſed eyes, although in this life when the field of mercy is open, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſo to aſtoniſh three hundred perſons who beheld it, that they fell unto the ground ſenſeleſs and without motion, and ſo continued for the ſpace of ſome hours. How will it then amaze us, when we ſhall behold not a dead Image, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf alive, not in the humility of the Croſs, but upon a Throne of Majeſty and Seat of Juſtice; not in a time of mercy, but in the hour of vengeance; not naked with pierced hands, but armed againſt Sinners with the Sword of Juſtice, when he ſhall come to judge and revenge the injuries which they have done him? God is as righteous in his juſtice, as in his mercy; and as he hath allotted a time for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo he will for juſtice; and as in this life the rigour of his juſtice is as it were repreſſed and ſuſpended, ſo in that point of death, when the Sinner ſhall receive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51068:84"/>judgment, it ſhall be let looſe, and overwhelm him. A great and rapid river, which ſhould for 30 or 40 years together have its current violently ſtopt, what a maſs of waters would it collect in ſo long a ſpace; and if it ſhould then be let looſe, with what fury would it overrun, and bear down all before it, and what reſiſtance could withſtand it? Since then the Divine juſtice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</note> which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> compares not to an ordinary River, but to a River of fire for the greatneſs and ſeverity of the rigour, ſhall be repreſſed for 30 or 40 years during the life of a man, what an infinity of wrath will it amaſs together, and with what fury will it burſt out upon the miſerable Sinners in the point of death? All this rigour and ſeverity ſhall the wretched Caytif behold in the face of the offended Judge. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith that a River of fire iſſued from his Countenance, and that his Throne was of flames, and the wheels of it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, becauſe all ſhall then be fire, rigour and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

The conſideration of this wrought ſo much with Abbot <hi>Agathon,</hi> when he was at the point of dying,<note place="margin">In vitis Pat.</note> that he continued three dayes in admiration, his eyes for fear and dread continually broad open without moving from one ſide to the other.

This is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, that the Throne and Tribunal of God was of flames, and that there ſhall proceed from his face a river of fire; becauſe fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is the moſt active, nimble, and vehement of all the Elements, is alſo the moſt pure, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mixture of any thing.

                  <p>It is to be admired how many dare do ill in the preſence of that Judge, with whom nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail but doing well; and the wonder is much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we dare with our evil works offend him, who is to judge them. The Theef is not ſo impudent as to rob his neighbour, if the Magiſtrate look on, but would be held a fool, if he ſhould rob or offend the Magiſtrate himſelf in his own houſe: How dares then this poor thing of man injure the very perſon of his moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and juſt Judge (before whom it is moſt certain he ſhall appear) to his face, in his own houſe, in ſo high a manner as to preferre the Devil, his and our greateſt enemy, before him? How great was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Jews, when they judged it fitter that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi> ſhould live, than the Son of God? Let the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then conſider his own inſolence, who judges it better to pleaſe the Devil, than Chriſt his Redeemer. Every one who ſins makes as it were a Judgment, and paſſes a Sentence in favour of Satan againſt Jeſus Chriſt. Of this unjuſt Judgment of man the Son of God, who is moſt unjuſtly ſentenced by a Sinner, will at the laſt day take a moſt ſtrict and ſevere account. Let him expect from his own injuſtice how great is to be the Divine juſtice againſt him. Let a Chriſtian therefore conſider that he hath not now his own but the cauſe of Chriſt in hand. Let him take heed how he works, ſince all his actions are to be viewed and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51068:86"/>reviewed by his Redeemer. An Artiſt who knew his work was to appear before ſome King, or to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome great Maſter in the ſame art, would ſtrive to give it the greateſt perfection of his skill. Since therefore all our works are to appear before the King of Heaven, and the chief Maſter of vertues <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> let us endeavour that they may be perfect and compleat, and the rather becauſe he is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them for curioſitie, but to paſs upon us a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, either of condemnation or eternal happineſs. Let us then call to mind that we are to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto God Almighty, and let us therefore take heed what we doe; let us weep for what is amiſs; let us forſake our ſins, and ſtrive to do vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; let us look upon our ſelves as guilty offenders: and let us ſtand in perpetual fear of the Judge, as Abbot <hi>Amno</hi> adviſes us; of whom it is reported in the Book of the lives of Fathers tranſlated by <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,<note place="margin">In vitis Pat. lib. <hi>5.</hi>

                     <p>ANother thing of great horror is to happen in the end of life, which ſhall make that hour, wherein the Soul expires, moſt horrible unto ſinners, and That is the ſight of their own ſins; whoſe deformity and multitude ſhall then clearly and diſtinctly appear unto them; and although now we remain in ignorance of many, and ſee the guilt of none, they ſhall then, when we leave this life, fully diſcover themſelves as they are both in number and quality. This is alſo ſignified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he ſayes, That the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51068:87"/>Throne of the Tribunal of God was of flaming fire: whoſe nature is not onely to burn, but to enlighten; and therefore in that Divine Judgment ſhall not onely be executed the rigour of his juſtice, but the uglineſs likewiſe of humane malice ſhall be diſcovered. The Judge himſelf ſhall not onely appear ſevere and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, but our ſins ſhall be laid open before us, and the ſight of them ſhall make us quake and tremble with fear and aſtoniſhment; eſpecially when we ſhall perceive them to be manifeſt unto him who is both Judge and Party.

                        <hi>and troubled with thy fury:</hi> and immediately giving the reaſon of that trouble, he ſaith, <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſet our wickedneſs before thee, and placed them in thy ſight.</hi> The monſtrouſneſs of ſin is now covered, and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not, and are not therefore much troubled; but in that inſtant of death, when the uglineſs of it ſhall appear, the very ſight of it will wholly confound us. Our ſins now ſeem unto us but light and trivial, and we ſee not half of them: but in our leaving of this life we ſhall find them heavy, grievous and unſupportable. A great Beam, whileſt it floats upon the river, a child may move and draw it from place to place, and the half of it remains hidden and covered below the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but draw it to land, many men will not ſuffice to remove it, and the whole bulk of it will be then clearly diſcovered; ſo in the waters of this tempeſtuous and unſtable life our faults appear not heavy, and the half of them are conceal'd from us: but this life once ended, we ſhall then feel their weight, diſcover their bulk, and ſhall groan under ſo heavy and grievous a burthen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe doubtleſs are the two ſwords which then ſhall mortally wound the conſcience of a ſinner: Firſt when he ſhall perceive the innumerable multitude of his ſins, and Then their monſtrous deformity. And to begin with their multitude, how ſhall he remain amazed,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51068:88"/>when he ſhall ſee a number of his actions to be ſins, which he never thought to be ſuch: and which is more, when he ſhall find that to be a fault, which he thought to be a laudable work? For this it is ſaid in one of the Pſalms, <hi>when I ſhall take time, I will judge righteouſneſs;</hi> for many actions which in the eyes of men ſeem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, will then be found vices in the ſight of God. If in humane judgments there be ſo great a difference, that young men, and thoſe that follow the world, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eſteem that for a vertue, which the wiſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient repute as an errour, how different ſhall be the divine judgment from that of men, ſince the holy Ghoſt ſaith by his Prophet, that the Judgments of God are a great Abyſs, and that his thoughts are as far diſtant from the thoughts of men, as heaven is from earth? And if ſpiritual men are ſo clear ſighted, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn with truth what worldlings praiſe, what ſhall be thoſe Divine eyes, which are able to perceive a ſtain in what appears Angelical purity? And if, as the Scripture ſayes, he found wickedneſs in the Angels, what vice can remain hid in the Sons of men? Our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith by one of his Prophets, <hi>I will ſearch Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with a candle.</hi> If ſo ſtrict enquiry be to be made in the holy City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> what ſhall be in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> If God ſhall uſe ſuch rigour with the juſt, how ſhall he diſſemble with his enemies? Then ſhall be brought to light the works which we have done, and thoſe which we have left undone: the evil of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which we have committed, and the good of that which we have omitted. Neither is there account to be taken onely of the evils which we do, but of the good alſo which we do not well; all will be ſtrictly ſearcht and narrowly lookt into, and muſt paſs by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes. The Devil, as our accuſer, ſhall frame the Proceſs of our whole life, and ſhall accuſe us of all he knows; and if any thing ſhall eſcape his knowledge, it ſhall not therefore be conceal'd; for our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall cry out and accuſe us of it; and leaſt out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51068:88"/>Conſcience might flatter us, or be ignorant of ſome faults, our Angel-Guardian, who is now our Governor and Tutor, ſhall then be the Fiſcal and Accuſer, calling for Divine juſtice againſt us, and ſhall diſcover what our own Souls are ignorant of. And if the Devil, our Conſcience, and Angel-Guardian ſhall fail in any thing as not knowing all, the Judge himſelf, who is both Party and Witneſs, and whoſe Divine knowledge pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates into the bottom of our wills, ſhall there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare many things for vices, which were here eſteemed for vertues. O ſtrange way of Judgment, where none denies, and all accuſe, even the offender accuſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and where all are Witneſſes, even the Judge and Party! O dreadful Judgment where there is no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and four Accuſers, the Devil, thy Conſcience, thy Angel-Guardian, and thy very. Judge, who will accuſe thee of many things which thou thoughteſt to have alleaged for thy defence!</p>
                     <p>O how great ſhall then be the confuſion, when that ſhall be found a ſin which was thought a ſervice! who would have imagined but that <hi>Oza,</hi> when he upheld the Ark in danger of falling, had rather done a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action, than an offence? yet the Lord chaſtized it as a great ſin with the puniſhment of a moſt diſaſtrous death: ſhewing thereby how different the Divine Judgments are from thoſe of men. Who would not have thought <hi>Davids</hi> numbring of his people to have been an act of policy and diſcretion? yet God judged it an offence, and puniſhed it with an unexampled Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which in ſo ſhort a time deſtroyed threeſcore and ten thouſand perſons? When <hi>Saul</hi> urged by his approaching enemies, and the long delayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> offered ſacrifice, he thought he had done an act of the greateſt vertue, which is religion: but God called it by the name of a grievous ſin, and for doing it reproved him, and caſt him off from being King. Who would not have judged it for an act of magnanimity and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when <hi>Achab,</hi> having conquered <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of

But this which was ſo much eſteemed and praiſed by men, was ſo diſagreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that he ſent him word by his Prophet, that he ſhould dye for it, and that he and his people ſhould bear the puniſhment, which was deſigned unto the <hi>Syrians</hi> and their King. If then the Judgment of God in this life be ſo far different from that of man, what ſhall it be in that moſt dreadful hour, which God hath reſerved for the executing of his Divine juſtice? Then all ſhall be laid open, and confuſion ſhall cover the ſinner with the multitude of his offences. How ſhall he bluſh to ſee himſelf in the preſence of the King of Heaven in ſo foul and ſqualid garments? A man is ſaid to remain confounded, when either the iſſue of things fall out contrary to what he hoped and looked for, or when he comes off with indignity or diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he expected honour and reward; how confounded then ſhall a ſinner be, when thoſe works of his, which he thought vertues, ſhall be found vices, imagining he hath done ſervice ſhall perceive he hath offended, and hoping for a reward ſhall meet with puniſhment? If a man when he is to ſpeak with ſome great Prince deſire to be decently and well clad, how will he be out of countenance to appear before him dirty and half naked? How ſhall then a ſinner be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſee himſelf before the Lord of all naked of good works, be dirtied and defiled with abominable and horrid crimes? for beſides the Multitude of ſins, whereof his whole life ſhall be full, the Hainouſneſs of them ſhall be alſo laid open before him, and he ſhall tremble at the ſight of that which he now thinks but a trivial fault. For then ſhall he ſee clearly the uglineſs of ſin, the diſſonancy of it unto reaſon, the deformity it cauſes in the Soul, the injury it does unto the Lord of the world, his ingratitude to the blood of Chriſt, the prejudice it brings unto himſelf, hell into which he falls, and eternal glory which he loſes. The leaſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51068:89"/>of theſe were ſufficient to cover his heart with ſadneſs and inconſolable grief: but altogether what amazement and confuſion ſhall they cauſe? eſpecially when he ſhall perceive, that not only mortal, but even venial ſins produce an uglineſs in the Soul beyond all the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deformities which can be imagined. If the ſight of onely one Devil be ſo horrible, that many Servants of God have ſaid, that they would rather ſuffer all the torments of this life, than behold him for one moment, all his deformity proceeding but from one onely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin which he committed, for before the Devils were by nature moſt excellent and beautiful: in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall a ſinner be, who ſhall not only behold all Devils in all their uglineſs, but ſhall ſee himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more ugly than many of them, having as many deformities, as he hath committed mortal and venial ſins? Let him therefore avoid them now; for all are to come to light, and he muſt account for all even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the laſt farthing.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this account to be made in groſs onely for the greateſt and moſt apparent ſins, but even for the leaſt and ſmalleſt. What Lord is ſo ſtrict with his Steward, that he demands an account for trifles, for the tagg of a point, nor ſuffers him to paſs a half-penny without informing him, how it was ſpent? In humane Tribunals the Judge takes no notice of ſmall matters but in the Courts of Divine Judicature nothing paſſes: the leaſt things are as diligently lookt into as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Afterwards I ſaw, that the demerits were weighed with great attention, and that little regard was made of the merits; For this reaſon. I ſpake the ſecond words. And ſeeing that the merits were ſo few
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51068:91"/>and inconſiderable for to be juſtified, I ſpake the third: And in regard that with the merits of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt our Saviour the balance, wherein my good works were, weighed more than the other, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a favourable ſentence was given in my behalf; For this reaſon I ſaid now 'tis well.

                     <p>THere is alſo in the end of life another cauſe of much terrour unto Sinners, which is the lively knowledge, which they ſhall have of the divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received, and the Charge which ſhall be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for their great ingratitude and abuſe of them. This is alſo ſignified by what the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſpake of the Throne and Tribunal of God. For he not onely ſaid it was of flames of fire, by which was given us to underſtand the rigour of divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt Sinners ſignified by the violence, heat, and activity of fire, and the diſcovery and manifeſtation of ſins, ſignified by the light and brightneſs of the flames: but he alſo adds, that from the face of the Judge there proceeded a heady and rapid river, which was alſo of fire, ſignifying by the ſwiftneſs of the courſe, and the iſſuing of it from God the multitude of his graces and benefits, which flowing from the divine goodneſs are communicated and poured down upon his Creatures. His ſaying that this ſo great river ſhall in that day be of fire, is to make us underſtand the rigour of that Charge againſt us for our abuſe of thoſe infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits beſtowed, together with the light and clearneſs, wherewith we ſhall know them, and the horrour and confuſion which ſhall then ſeiſe upon us for our great
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51068:91"/>ingratitude, and the ſmall account we have made of them: in ſo much as Sinners in that inſtant are not onely to ſtand in fear of their own bad works, but of the grace and benefits of God Almighty conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Another mourning Weed and confuſion ſhall cover them, when they ſhall ſee what God hath done to oblige and aſſiſt them toward their ſalvation, and what they to the contrary have done to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them their own damnation. They ſhall tremble to ſee what God did for their good, and that he did ſo much as he could do no more: all which hath been miſ-imployed and abuſed by themſelves. This is ſo clear and evident on the part of God Almighty, that he calls men themſelves as witneſſes and Judges of the truth; and therefore ſpeaking under the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a Vineyard by his Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.</note> he ſaith in this manner; <hi>Inhabitants of Jeruſalem and men of Judah, judge betwixt me and my Vineyard; what ought I to have done more unto my Vineyard, and have not done it?</hi> And after the incarnation of the Son of God the Lord turns again to upbraid men with the ſame reſentment, and ſignifies more fully the multitude of his benefits under the ſame Metaphor of a Vineyard,<note place="margin">

Let therefore men enter into judgement againſt themſelves, and let them be judges, whether God could have done more for them, and has not done it: they being ſtill ſo ungrateful towards their Creatour, as if he had been their enemy, and done them ſome notorious injury.</p>
                     <p>Coming therefore to conſider every one of theſe benefits by its ſelf, The firſt which occurs is that of the Creation, which was ſignified by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſaid, that <hi>He planted a Vineyard;</hi> and what could God do more for thee, ſince in this one benefit of thy Creation he gave thee all what thou art both in ſoul and body? If wanting an arm thou
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51068:92"/>wouldeſt eſteem thy ſelf much obliged and be very thankful unto him, who ſhould beſtow one upon thee, which were ſound, ſtrong and uſeful, why art thou not ſo to God, who hath given thee arms, heart, ſoul, body and all? Conſider what thou wert before he gave thee a being: Nothing; and now thou enjoyeſt not onely a being, but the beſt being of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal world. Philoſophers ſay, that betwixt being and not being there is an infinite diſtance. See then what thou oweſt unto thy Creatour, and thou ſhalt find thy debt to be no leſs than infinite, ſince he hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given thee a being, but a noble being, and that not by neceſſity, but out of an infinite love and by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, making choice of thee amongſt an infinity of men poſſible, whom he might have created. If lots were to be caſt amongſt a hundred perſons for ſome honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charge, how fortunate would he be eſteemed, who ſhould draw the lot from ſo many Competitors? behold then thy own happineſs, who from an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute nothing haſt light upon a being amongſt an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of creatures poſſible. And whence proceeds this ſingular favour, but from God, who out of thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs millions hath pickt out thee, leaving many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who, if he had created them, would have ſerved him better than thy ſelf? See then what God could have done for thee and has not, having choſen thee without any deſert of thine from amongſt ſo many, and preferred thee before thoſe, whom he foreſaw would have been more thankful. Beſides this he not onely created thee by election, and gave thee a noble being, but ſupernatural happineſs, being no way due unto thy nature, he created thee for it, and gave thee for thy end the moſt high and eminent, that could be imagined, to wit, the eternal poſſeſſion of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. It was enough for God to create thee for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural happineſs conformable to what thou wert, but he, not to leave any thing undone which he could do, created thee for a ſupernatural bleſſedneſs, in ſo much
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51068:92"/>as there is no creature, which hath a higher end then thy ſelf. See then if God could do more for thee, and has not; and ſee what thou oughteſt to do for him; ſee whereunto thou art obliged. For this onely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thou oughteſt not to move hand nor foot, but for the ſervice of ſo good and gracious a God. A labourer who plants a tree hath right unto the fruit: and God, who created thee, hath right unto thy works, which are the fruits of man. For this reaſon at the Garment of the High-Prieſt, which repreſented the benefit of our Creation, were hung many Pomgranates, which are the nobleſt fruit of trees, and bears a Crown, to ſignifie that the good fruits of holy works, which we ought to produce, are to be crowned with a perfect and pure intention. See then if thou canſt do more for God; for God could do no more for thee, than to create thee for ſo high and eminent an end, as is the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of himſelf, being no wayes due unto thy feeble and frail nature.</p>
                     <p>It being then ſo great a benefit to have created thee, it is yet a greater to have preſerved and ſuffered thee untill this inſtant without caſting thee into a thouſand hells for thy ſins and offences. This grace of conſervation our Saviour noted, when he ſaid that he compaſſed and encloſed his Vineyard, which was for the preſervation of it. See then what thy Creatour in this matter of conſervation could have done more than he hath done for thee, ſince being his enemy he hath preſerved thee as his friend. From how many for one onely fault committed hath he withdrawn his preſervation, and ſuffered them to die in that ſin, for which they are now in hell: &amp; ſome of them, if they had been pardoned, would have proved more grateful than thou? Behold how many Angels for their firſt offence he threw head-long down from heaven, and expected them no longer; and yet ſtill expects thee. See if he could do more for thee, and ſee what thou art to do for him. Conſider that thou oweſt him for preſerving
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51068:93"/>thee as much as for creating thee, preſervation being a continued creation, and more for preſerving and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thee although his enemy. In thy creation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou didſt not deſerve a being, yet thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited it not; but in thy preſervation thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the contrary, which is to be forſaken and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.</p>
                     <p>But above all what is ſaid is the benefit which thou receiveſt by the Incarnation of the Son of God: which Chriſt ſignified when he ſaid, that the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard ſent his Son. See if God could have done more for his own ſalvation than he did for thine, ſending into the world his onely begotten Son to be incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thee. A greater work than this could not be done by the omnipotent arm of God. Conſider that he did not this for the Angels, and yet did it for thee; ſee if then thou canſt comply with the love thou oweſt him with being leſs than a Seraphin in thy affection. Conſider likewiſe that it being in his power to redeem thee by making himſelf an Angel, and onely interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for thee, yet he would not deprive thy nature of this honour, but made himſelf a Man; ſee if he could do more for thy good. By making himſelf an Angel he might have honoured the Angelical nature, and have likewiſe benefited thee; but he would not: but making himſelf a Man, conferred both the honour and profit upon thee. And if it be true which ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay, that God having propoſed unto the Angels, that they were to adore a Man, who was alſo to be God, and to be exalted above all their Hierarchies, and that becauſe they would not ſubject themſelves unto an inferiour nature, they therefore fell and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came diſobedient: ſee what thou oweſt unto God for this ſo ſingular a favour, who would make himſelf a Man, that thou ſhouldeſt not be loſt, although with the loſs of ſo many Angels better than thee. Behold from whence he drew thee by this benefit, which was from ſin and hell: and at ſuch a time, when thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51068:93"/>condition was deſperate of all other remedy; behold unto what he exalted thee: to his grace and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold in what manner, and with what ſingular love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he did it, even to his own loſs and prejudice, and, as the Apoſtle ſaith, by annihilating as it were him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he might exalt thee, taking upon him thy nature when it was not needful, onely that he might conferre an honour upon thee, which he would not upon the Angels. See what God could do more for thee: and ſee that thou mayeſt do much more for him and doeſt not.</p>
                     <p>Of the benefit of our redemption by the death and paſſion of Chriſt the Lord himſelf was not forgetful, but ſignified it unto us, even before he died, ſaying That the Son, whom the Lord of the Vineyard ſent, was ſlain in the pretenſe. What could the Son of God do more for thee than die and ſhed his blood for thy benefit, eſpecially when it was not needful for thy redemption? In the rigour of juſtice it was neceſſary that God ſhould be incarnate, or make himſelf an Angel to redeem thee; but to ſuffer and die, not at all. But ſuch was his infinite love, as he would needs ſuffer, and not with an ordinary death, but would die ſo ignominiouſly, as it ſeems he could not ſuffer more. Set before thy eyes Chriſt crucified upon Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varie;</hi> ſee if a Man more infamous be poſſible or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, executed publickly between two Theeves as a Traitor, and an Heretick for broaching falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and making himſelf King, as a Traitor unto <hi>Caeſar;</hi> Two crimes ſo infamous, as they not onely defame the perſon who commits them, but ſtain and infect his whole Stock and Linage. Behold in what poverty he died, if greater can be thought on, to the end thou mayeſt ſee, if it were poſſible he ſhould doe more for thee than what he did. Whileſt he lived he had not whereon to repoſe his head, but yet had cloathes, wherewith to cover decently his nakedneſs; but when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51068:94"/>he died, even his garments failed him: neither found he one drop of water to refreſh his ſacred lips; even the earth refuſed him, wanting whereon to reſt his reverend feet. Behold with what grief and pains he expired, ſince from head to foot he was but one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued wound; his feet and hands were pierced with nails, and his head with thorns. All was a high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of an exceſſive love, and to do for thee what he could: ſee then what thou oughteſt to doe and ſuffer for him, who died and ſuffered for thee what he could, and could do what he would.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe benefits conſider his giving himſelf unto thee for food and ſuſtenance in the moſt holy Sacrament: the which was noted by Chriſt, when he ſaid, That the Lord of the Vineyard built a Preſs for the Wine, in which he gave his moſt precious blood. It ſeems that the perſons of the moſt holy Trinity were in competition, and ſtrove amongſt themſelves, who ſhould moſt oblige Man with their benefits and favours. Let us expreſs it in this manner: for to conceive it, as it is in it ſelf, the underſtanding of Angels were not ſufficient. Here may be applyed that which antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty admired in two great and famous Painters. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> went to <hi>Rhodes</hi> to ſee <hi>Protogenes,</hi> and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at home took a Penſil, and drew a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle line, charging the Servants that they ſhould tell their Maſter, that he who drew that line was there to ſeek him. When <hi>Protogenes</hi> returned, they told him what had happened: who took the Penſil, and drew a ſtroke of another colour through the middle of that which <hi>Apelles</hi> had drawn, and going about his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs commanded his Servants, that, if he came again, they ſhould tell him, that he whom he ſought for had drawn that line through the middle of his. It ſeemed there could not be imagined a higher favour and Courtſhip, than that of the Eternal Father to have given his onely Son, and have delivered him up to death for man; but through the middle of this favour
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51068:94"/>the Son drew another of moſt exceſſive fineneſs and ſubtilty, which is the inſtitution of the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, the which ſome call an Extenſion of the Incarnation, and is a Repreſentation of the Paſſion, and a Character and Memorial of the Wonders of God. Here truely did the Son of God draw the ſtroke of his infinite love, and conſummated all the Divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: not onely giving himſelf for our benefit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof, but entring into our very breaſts to ſolicit our love and affection. <hi>Anacreon</hi> writes, That ſtanding at defiance with the God of love, and having reſiſted all his arrows, the God at laſt, when he had no more to ſhoot, ſhot himſelf, and penetrating his heart and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails compell'd him to yield. What other are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of our Lord God, than ſo many arrows of love which Man reſiſts? and not rendring himſelf neither at the benefit of Creation, Conſervation, Incarnation, or Paſſion, let him at laſt render himſelf at this, when God ſhoots himſelf into him, and enters into his very breaſt and bowels to ſolicite his love. If he reſiſt this alſo, what judgements expect him? Whereupon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that he who preſumes to communicate unworthily, eats and drinks the judgement of God, that is, ſwallows down the whole weight of Divine juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then how dreadful it ſhall be unto a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he ſhall receive a charge not onely of his own being, and his own life, but alſo of the being and life or God, of the Incarnation, Paſſion, Life and Death of Chriſt our Redeemer, who hath ſo often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf unto him in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. The Murtherer who ſtands charged with the life of a man, although it be of ſome wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet fears to be apprehended and brought to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how is it then that he, who is charged with the life of God, trembles not? O how fearful a thing is it, when a vile creature ſhall enter into judgement with his Creatour, and ſhall be demanded an account of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51068:95"/>the blood of Chriſt, whoſe value is infinite? What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can he give of ſuch a benefit, and of all the reſt, which he hath received, even from the greateſt unto the leaſt? when Chriſt ſhall ſay unto him thoſe words of St. <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. <hi>24.</hi> in Math.</note> 
                        <q>I, when thou hadſt no being, gave thee one, inſpired thee with a Soul, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee above all things that are upon the Earth. I for thee created Heaven, Air, Sea, Earth, and all things, and yet am diſhonoured by thee, and held more vile and baſe than the Devil himſelf: and yet for all this have not ceaſed to do thee good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee innumerable benefits. For thy ſake, being God, I was content to make my ſelf a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, was buffetted, ſpit upon, and condemned to a puniſhment of Slaves: and to redeem thee from death ſuffered the death of the Croſs. In Heaven I interceded for thee, and from thence ſent thee the Holy Ghoſt; I invited thee unto the Kingdom of Heaven, offered my ſelf to be thy Head, thy Spouſe, thy Garment, thy Houſe, thy Root, thy Food, thy Drink, thy Shepheard, thy Brother, I choſe thee for the Heir of Heaven, and drew thee out of darkneſs unto light.</q> To ſuch exceſſes of love what have we to anſwer, but to ſtand aſtoniſht and confounded, that we have been ſo ungrateful, and given occaſion to the Devil of one of the greateſt ſcorns and injuries, which could be put upon our Redeemer, when he ſhall ſay unto him: Thou createdſt man; for him waſt born in poverty, livedſt in labours, and diedſt in pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have done nothing for him, but would have drunk his blood, and ſought to damn him into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hells; and yet for all this it is I whom he ſtrives to pleaſe, and not thee. Thou doeſt prepare for him a Crown of eternal glory, I deſire to torment him in hell: and yet he had rather ſerve me without intereſt, than thee for thy promiſe of ſo great a reward. I ſhould have been aſhamed to have created and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wretch ſo ungrateful unto him, from whom he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51068:95"/>hath received ſo great benefits; but ſince he loves me better than thee, let him be mine, unto whom he hath ſo often given up himſelf.</p>
                     <p>We are not onely to give an account of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefits, but of thoſe which are more particular: of the good examples which we have ſeen, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which we have heard, of the inſpirations which have been ſent us, and the Sacraments which we have received; we have much to do to correſpond with all theſe. Let us therefore tremble at that ſtrict judgement; let us tremble at our ſelves, who are ſo careleſs of that, for which all the care in the world is not ſufficient; And if it were not for the blood of Chriſt what would become of us? but the time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitting our ſelves by that will be then paſt; now is the time: and if we ſhall now deſpiſe and outrage it, in what caſe ſhall we be? Let us not miſpend the time of this life, ſince ſo ſevere an account will be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the benefits which we have received, one of which is the Time of this temporal life, and the bleſſings of it.

                  <p>ALl that we have hitherto ſpoken concerning the rigour of the Divine Tribunal, before which the Soul is at the end of life to appear, and to give an account unto his Redeemer, is far ſhort of what really is to be.

I will charge thee with all thy miſdeeds, and thy abominations ſhall be in the middle of thee: and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord which ſmites.</hi> And preſently he adds, <hi>My wrath ſhall be upon all the people, the ſword without, and peſtilence and famine within; he who is in the field ſhall die by the ſword, and they who are in the City ſhall be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by peſtilence and famine: and they who flye, ſhall ſave themſelves, and ſhall all remain in the Mountains, as the Doves of the Valleys, trembling in their iniquity: their hands ſhall be disjoynted, and their knees ſhall reſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water, for the great fear and amazement which God in his wrath ſhall ſend vpon them.</hi> But it is not much that the Lord ſhould deal thus with ſinners, who have forſaken their God, ſince even againſt thoſe, who are deſirous to do all for his honour, he proceeds with

                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.</note> Let us ſee how the Prophet <hi>Zacharit</hi> ſets forth unto us the High-Prieſt who then lived, the Son of <hi>Joſedeck,</hi> as a lively repreſentation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgement, whom he makes to appear before an Angel who there exerciſed the Office of a Judge; cloathed in foul and polluted Garments, in ſo much as the Lord calls him a Brand taken out of the fire, and Satan ſtanding by his ſide to accuſe him. If then this great Prieſt, zealous of the glory of God, ſtood ſo dejected and confuſed in the preſence of an Angel, as he appeared as a black and burnt coal of hell in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and ſooty Garments, how ſhall a grievous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and deſpiſer of the Divine ſervice appear before God himſelf? But this is more fully ſignified in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> where our Saviour himſelf pronounced judgement againſt the ſeaven Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who were then all alive, and moſt of them eſteemed great Servants of God, and ſo holy, as was St. <hi>Timothy</hi> the beloved Diſciple of <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> St. <hi>Quadratus,</hi> St. <hi>Carpus,</hi> St. <hi>Sagaris,</hi> all in great opinion for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and holineſs of life. Let us firſt behold in what manner our Saviour Chriſt appeared when he came to judge them, and after let us conſider the rigorous charge which he laid againſt them. For the firſt, to ſignifie that nothing could be hid or concealed from him, he ſtood in the middeſt of ſeaven Candleſticks, or of ſeaven Lamps like the Golden Candleſtick in the Temple, in each of which was a lighted Candle; in his hand he held ſeaven Stars, whoſe beams and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour enlightned all about him: and above all his face was as the Sun at midday in his greateſt force, which leaves not the leaſt atome undiſcovered. In ſuch a brightneſs of Candles, Stars, and Sun there was no ſhadow; to give us to underſtand that nothing how little ſoever can be hidden from the all-ſeeing eyes of our moſt juſt Judge, unto whom all things will appear clearly and diſtinctly as they are in themſelves; but not content with ſo many arguments of the evidence;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51068:97"/>which he ſhall have of all offences, he adds That the eyes of the Judge were as flaming fire, more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than the eyes of <hi>Lynceus,</hi> to ſee and ſearch into all things, and to note alſo the rigour and ſeverity wherewith he looks upon offences, when he comes to judge them. This certainly were ſufficient of it ſelf to ſet forth the rigour of his juſtice, but to make it appear yet more terrible he declares it by another fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a two-edged Sword, which he held in his mouth, to denote that the rigour of his works ſhall be greater than thoſe of his words, although his words themſelves were as cutting ſwords. In concluſion all was ſo full of terrour and threatning, as, although it nothing concerned St. <hi>John</hi> as being none of thoſe who were to be judged, yet it cauſed ſo great a fear and amazement in him, that he fell as dead upon the ground. If then St. <hi>John</hi> only beholding the wrathful countenance of our Lord, not againſt himſelf, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with whom alſo he intended to uſe mercy, it made his feet to fail, and his pulſes to remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion, how ſhall it fare with that ſinner who ſhall behold him all incenſed againſt him, and that at ſuch a time when he is onely to uſe his juſtice? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if the Souls of Sinners were capable of death, the terrour of that fight would bereave them of a thouſand lives.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee what was found by thoſe eyes of fire, with which Chriſt ſo narrowly examined the works of thoſe ſeaven Biſhops, who were ſuch as he himſelf vouchſafes to call them Angels. Truly he found much to reprehend in them, that it might be verified which was ſpoken in <hi>Job,</hi> that he found ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in his Angels. Who would have thought, that St. <hi>Timothy,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle was ſo confident, and of whom he made ſo great eſteem, ſhould deſerve that God ſhould take away his Chair, and deprive him of his Church of <hi>Epheſus?</hi> yet Chriſt found him worthy of ſo great a chaſtiſement, and threatens to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51068:97"/>do it, if he did not amend: and complains that he was fallen from his former zeal, exhorting him to do penance, which certainly he performed, as perceiving it very neceſſary for him. Greater faults he found in the Biſhop of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> as alſo in him of <hi>Thiatira,</hi> who was St. <hi>Carpus:</hi> and in like manner exhorts them both to do penance. And that it may appear how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are the judgements of God from thoſe of men, although the Biſhop of <hi>Sardis</hi> was held by all for a moſt holy man, that he had gained a great opinion of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that he did many good works, yet Jeſus Chriſt found he was ſo far from being a Saint, that he remained in mortal ſin. O holy good God, who would not tremble, that he who paſſed amongſt men for an Angel, ſhould by thee be reputed as a Devil? but no leſs dreadful is that which paſſed with the Biſhop of <hi>Laodicia,</hi> whoſe Conſcience did not accuſe him of any thing, who thought he had complyed with his obligations, that he exerciſed great vertues, had no remorſe of any grievous fault or matter of importance, and yet for all this he was ſo contrary in the Divine ſight, that the Lord ſayes he was a miſer and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, poor, blind and naked of all vertue. Well ſaid the Wiſe-man, <hi>That man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love or hate.</hi> And David had reaſon to demand of God that he would cleanſe him from the ſins he knew not. O moſt holy Lord and moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, how happens it that men fear thee not, ſince for what they themſelves know they ought to tremble; and although they hold themſelves for juſt, and are not conſcious of any enormous fault, yet that which thou knoweſt onely is ſufficient to condemn them? Let us quake that God is to demand an account of thoſe ſins, which we our ſelves are ignorant of, as he did of this Biſhop of <hi>Laodicia,</hi> and alſo of ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by others, as he did of him of <hi>Thiatira.</hi> The divine eyes of Chriſt pierce not only into our ſecret ſins, and the ſins of others, but alſo diſcover thoſe of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51068:98"/>Omiſſion; and therefore he reprehended the omiſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> although he was very faithful unto God in all good works, and ſought his glory, and the exaltation of his holy name; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſearches into all our evil works as well known as hid, as well our own as others, and alſo into our good works, when they are not done with fervour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Let us tremble that in St. <hi>Timothy</hi> he found his works not fervent: but much more that in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who was irreprehenſible, and had not ſlackned nor fallen off from his firſt zeal, yet he found wherein to reprehend him, not for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of what was bad, not for omiſſion of what was good, not for remiſſion of his former fervour, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he had little vertue, whereas in truth this moſt holy Biſhop had great merits, for which he was much favoured and beloved of God. But as our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations are infinite, ſo there is no vertue, no ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cty, which in his fight appears not little. So preciſe, ſo exact is the Divine judgement, that of ſeaven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which were reputed Angels, he found in ſix wherewith to judge and reprehend them; in one neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in another inconſtancy and diſmaidneſs, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlackneſs and remiſsneſs of zeal, in another wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and want of perſeverance, in another fear, in another tepidneſs and indiſcretion, and in two at leaſt that they were in mortal ſin. And if in ſuch Angels his divine eyes found wherewith to be offended, what will they find in us ſinners?</p>
                  <p>The knowledge, that Chriſt had judged them, was of great profit unto thoſe Biſhops, cauſing them ever after to comply with their duties with great fervour; and for thoſe, who are known who they were, it is certain that they died Saints, and for ſuch are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the holy Church. It may alſo be profitable unto us, to know that we are likewiſe to be judged with equal rigour, that we may not offend him, unto whom we owe ſo much; that we may not be tepid
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51068:98"/>in his ſervice, but perform our works fully, perfectly and compleatly. Let the tepid fear thoſe words which our Saviour ſaid unto one of thoſe Biſhops,<note place="margin">

Let us trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this threat; be Careful alſo, that ſo we may not hear from the mouth of Chriſt, that which he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Biſhop of <hi>Sardis, I find not thy works full before my God.</hi> Let us therefore ſee how our Charity ſtands, whether it be full or not. For it is not full, if we love this man, and not that; if we wiſh well unto our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and abhorre him who does us injurie; if we work onely and not alſo ſuffer; let us ſee if we bear the burthens of our neighbour as if they were our own; if we preferre the conveniency of others before our own; if we embrace with a deſire of pleaſing God Almighty things hard and painful; and if we love him not with words but deeds. Let us ſee if our Humility be full, if we do not onely hate honours, but deſire to be deſpiſed; if we do not onely not preferre our ſelves before any, but abaſe our ſelves below all. Let us ſee if our Patience be full; if we had not rather ſuffer this than that; if we do not onely ſuffer, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Let us ſee whether our Obedience be full; if we obey in things eaſie, and not in difficult and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; if our equal, and not inferiour; if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and not upon Man; if we do it with repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, and not with delight. See if the reſt of thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be full: thou art to give an account of all; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give a good one; ſee if thou be not found
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51068:99"/>in that day with vain and empty works; for thou ſhalt not onely be demanded, if thou haſt done them good ones, but if thou haſt done them well. If even in this life God will chaſtize our careleſneſs, what will he do in the other?</p>
                  <p>Let us draw ſtrength out of weakneſs, that we may with all our power and all our forces ſerve him who hath done ſo much for us. Let us ſee what we have received, that we may know what we are to return; let us look upon the greatneſs of thoſe benefits which have been conferred upon us, that we may know how to meaſure our gratitude accordingly: and as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of God have been full and plentifully heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, let not our thanks and ſervices be ſhort and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly.

                  <argument>
                     <p> Of the End of all Time.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEſides the end of the particular time of this life, the univerſal end of all time is much to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; that, ſince humane ambition paſſes the limits of this life, and deſires honour and a famous memory after it, Man may know that after this death, there is another death to follow, in which his memory ſhall alſo die and vaniſh away as ſmoke. After that we have finiſht the time of this life, the end of all time is to ſucceed, which is to give a period unto all which we leave behind us. Let man therefore know that thoſe things, which he leaves behind for his memory after death, are as vain as thoſe which he enjoyed in life. Let him raiſe proud Mauſoleums, Let him erect Statues of Marble, Let him build populous Cities, Let him leave a numerous Kindred, Let him write learned Books, Let him ſtamp his Name in braſs, and fix his Memory with a thouſand nails, All muſt have an end; his Cities ſhall ſink, his Statues fall, his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Linage periſh, his Books be burned, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory be defaced, and all ſhall end, becauſe all time muſt end. It much imports us to perſwade our ſelves of this truth, that we may not be deceived in the things of this world, That not only our pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are to end in death, but our memories at the fartheſt are to end with Time; And ſince all are to conclude, all are to be deſpiſed as vain and periſhing. <hi>Cicero,</hi> although immoderately deſirous of fame and honour,<note place="margin">Cieer. in Ep. ad Luc.</note> as appears by a large Epiſtle of his written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a friend, wherein he earneſtly entreats him to write the conſpiracy of <hi>Cataline,</hi> which was diſcovered by himſelf, in a Volume apart, and that he would allow ſomething in it unto their ancient friendſhips, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51068:100"/>Publiſh it in his life time, that he might enjoy the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it whileſt he lived: yet when he came to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the world was to end in Time, he perceived that no glory could be immortal, and therefore ſayes, <hi>By reaſon of deluges and burnings of the earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Somn. Scip.</note> 
                     <hi>which mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

But this truth is like the memory of death, which by how much it is more important, by ſo much men think leſt of it, and practically do not believe it. But God, that his divine providence and care might not be wanting, hath alſo in this taken order, that a matter of ſo great concernment ſhould be publiſhed with all ſolemnity, firſt by his Son, after by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and then by Angels.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10.</note> And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> writes in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> that he ſaw an Angel of great might and power, who deſcended from heaven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Cloud for his Garment, and his head covered with a Rainbow, his face ſhining as the Sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, with the right foot treading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, and with the left upon the Earth, ſending forth a great and terrible voice as the roaring of a Lyon, which was anſwered by ſeaven thunders with other moſt dreadful noiſes; and preſently this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Angel lifts up his hand towards Heaven. But wherefore all this Ceremony? wherefore this ſtrange equipage? wherefore this horrid voice and thunder? all was to proclaim the death of Time, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us more of the infallibility of it, he continued it with a ſolemn Oath conceived in a Set form of moſt authentique words, liſting up his hand towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſwearing by him that lives for ever and ever, who created Heaven and Earth, and all which is in it, <hi>There ſhall be mo more time.</hi> With what could this truth be more confirmed, than by the Oath of ſo great and powerful and an Angel?</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:51068:100"/>
                  <p>The greatneſs and ſolemnity of the Oath gives us to underſtand the weight and gravity of the thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed both in reſpect of it ſelf, and the importance of us to know it. If the death of a Monarch or Prince of ſome corner of the world, prognoſticated by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe or Comet, cauſe a fear and amazement in the beholders, what ſhall the death of the whole World, and with it all things temporal, and of Time it ſelf foretold by an Angel with ſo prodigious an appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo dreadful a noiſe produce in them, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider it? For us alſo this thought is moſt convenient, whereby to cauſe in us a contempt of all things temporal. Let us therefore be practically per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that not onely this life ſhall end, but that there ſhall be alſo an end of Time. Time ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave Man of this life, and Time ſhall bereave the World of his, whoſe end ſhall be no leſs horrible than that of Man; but how much the whole World and the whole Race of mankind exceeds one particular perſon, by ſo much ſhall the univerſal end ſurpaſs in terrour the particular end of this life. For this cauſe the Prophecies, which foretell the end of the World, are ſo dreadful, that if they were not dictated by the holy Spirit of God, they would be thought incredible. Chriſt therefore our Saviour having uttered ſome of them unto his Diſciples, becauſe they ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all that could be imagined, in the concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them with that manner of Oath or Aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he commonly uſed in matters of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 13. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Amen</hi> (which is, By my verity, or verily) <hi>I ſay unto you, that the world ſhall not end before all theſe things are fulfilled. Heaven and earth ſhall fail, but my words ſhall not fail.</hi> Let us believe then that Time ſhall end, and that the World ſhall die, and that, if we may ſo ſay, a moſt horrible and diſaſtrous death; let us believe it, ſince the Angels and the Lord of Angels have ſworn it. If it be ſo then, that thoſe memorials of men, which ſeemed immortal, muſt at laſt end, ſince
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51068:101"/>the whole Race of man is to end, let us only ſtrive to be preſerved in the eternal memory of him, who hath no end; and let us no leſs deſpiſe to remain in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding memory of men who are to die, than to enjoy the pleaſures of our ſenſes which are to periſh. As the hoarding up of riches upon earth is but a deceit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, ſo the deſire of eternizing our memory is an errour of Ambition. The covetous man muſt then leave his wealth when he leaves his life, if the Theef in the mean time do not take it from him: and fame and renown muſt end with the World, if envy or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion deface it not before. All, that is to end, is vain; this World therefore and all which is eſteemed in it is vain, all is vanity of vanities, Let us onely aim and aſpire unto the eternal, becauſe the juſt onely, as the Prophet ſayes, ſhall remain in the eternal memory of God. The memory of man is (as men themſelves) frail and periſhing. What man ambitious of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual memory would not rather chooſe to be eſteemed by ten men, who were to live a hundred years, than, by a thouſand, who were to die immediately after him? Let us therefore deſire to be in the memory of God, whoſe life is eternity. Our memory amongſt men can laſt no longer than men themſelves, which ſhall all die like us; and there can be no memory im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal amongſt thoſe who are mortal. It is therefore very expedient, that the end of the World ſhould be accompanied by the univerſal Judgement of all men, wherein ſhall be revealed their moſt ſecret and hidden thoughts and anions: That the murtherer who hath ſlain his neighbour, leſt he ſhould diſcover his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, may not hope that therefore it ſhall remain conceal'd: and That no, man ſhould be bold to ſin for want of witneſſes, ſince the whole World ſhall then know that, which, if any but himſelf had known here, would have burſt his heart with ſhame and ſorrow.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>LEt us now look upon the ſtrange manner of the end of the World, which being ſo terrible, gives us to underſtand the vanity and deceit of all things in it, and the great abuſe of them by man; for queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were it not for the great malice and wickedneſs, which raigns in the World, the period of it would not be ſo horrible and diſaſtrous.<note place="margin">Lib. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognit.</note> S. <hi>Clement</hi> the Roman writes that he learned of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, that God had appointed a day from all eternity, wherein the Army of Vengeance ſhould with all its forces, and, as we may ſay, in ranged battail fight with the Army of Sin; which day is uſually called in the holy Scripture The day of the Lord: in which battail the Army of Vengeance ſhall prevail, and ſhall at once extirpate and make an end both of Sin and the World, wherein it hath ſo long raigned. And certainly if the terrour of that day ſhall equal the multitude and hainouſneſs of ſins, we need not wonder at what the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and holy Fathers have foretold of it. But as it is uſual in war res to skirmiſh and make inrodes before the day of battel, ſo before that dreadful day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all puniſhments are to encounter with all offences, the Lord ſhall from divers parts ſend forth ſeveral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, which ſhall be fore-runners of that great day of battel, and ſhall like light Horſe-men ſcoure the Campania: which St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> ſignified by thoſe Horſe-men, which he ſaw ſally forth upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers-coloured horſes, one red, another black, and the third pale: ſo the Lord ſhall before that day ſend Plagues, Famine, Warres, Earthquakes, Droughts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations,

                     <hi>His zeal ſhall take up arms, and ſhall arm the creatures to revenge him of his enemies; he ſhall put on Juſtice as a breaſt-plate, and righteous Judgement as a helmet, and he ſhall take Equity as a buckler, and ſhall ſharpen his Wrath as a lance, and the circuit of the earth ſhall fight for him. Thunderbolts ſhall be ſent from the clouds as from a well-ſhooting how, and ſhall nit fail to hit the mark, and Hail ſhall be ſent full of ſtormy wrath. The Waters of the ſea ſhall threaten them, the Rivers ſhall combat fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, a moſt ſtrong Wind ſhall riſe againſt them, and ſhall divide them as a whirle-wind.</hi> Very dreadful are thoſe words, although they contain but the Warre, which three of the Elements are to make againſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but not onely Fire, Air and Water, but Earth alſo and Heaven (as it appears in other places of Scripture) ſhall fall upon them and confound them; for all creatures ſhall expreſs their fury in that day, and ſhall riſe againſt man: and if the clouds ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thunderbolts and ſtones upon their heads, the Heavens ſhall ſhoot no leſs balls than Stars, which, as Chriſt ſayes, ſhall fall from thence. If Hail no bigger than little ſtones falling but from the clouds deſtroy the fields, and ſometimes kills the leſſer ſort of cattle, what ſhall pieces of Stars do falling from the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſome upper Region?</p>
                  <p>It is no amplification which the Goſpel uſes, when it ſayes, That men ſhall wither with fear of what ſhall fall upon the whole frame of nature: for as in Man, which is called the Leſſer world, when he is to die, the humours, which are as the Elements, are troubled and out of order, his eyes, which are as the Sun and Moon, are darkned, his other ſenſes, which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51068:102"/>are as the leſſer ſtars, fall away, his reaſon, which is as the celeſtial vertues, is off the hinges: ſo in the death of the greater World, before it diſſolve and expire, the Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, the Moon into blood, the Stars ſhall fall, and the whole World ſhall tremble with a horrid noiſe. If the Sun, Moon, and other celeſtial bodies, which are held incorruptible, ſhall ſuffer ſuch changes, what ſhall be done with thoſe frail and corruptible Elements of Earth, Air, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? If this inferiour World do, as the Philoſophers ſay, depend upon the Heavens, thoſe celeſtial bodies being altered and broken in pieces, in what eſtate muſt the lower Elements remain, when the Vertues of Heaven ſhall faulter, and the wandring Stars ſhall loſe their way, and fail to obſerve their order? How ſhall the Air be troubled with violent and ſudden Whirle-winds, dark Tempeſts, horrible Thunders, and furious flaſhes of Lightning? and how ſhall the Earth tremble with dreadful Earth-quakes, opening her ſelf with a thouſand mouthes, and caſting forth as it were whole Volcanies of fire and ſulphur, and not content to overthrow the loftieſt Towers, ſhall ſwallow up high Mountains, and bury whole Cities in her entrails? How ſhall the Sea then rage, mounting his proud waves above the clouds, as if they meant to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the whole Earth, and ſhall certainly drown a great part of it?

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51068:103"/>poſſeſs them, when they ſhall hourly expect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and dire effects portended by theſe monſtrous prodigies? All Commerce ſhall then ceaſe, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places ſhall be unpeopled, and the Tribunals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſolitary and ſilent; none ſhall be then ambitious of honours, none ſhall ſeek after paſtimes and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented pleaſures; nor ſhall the covetous wretch then buſie himſelf with the care of his treaſures; none ſhall frequent the Palaces of Kings and Princes, but through fear ſhall forget even to eat and drink; all their care ſhall be employed how to eſcape thoſe Deluges, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and lightnings, ſeeking for places of ſecurity which they ſhall not meet with. Who will then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his own Deſcent and Linage? who the nobleneſs of his Arms and atchievements? who his Wiſdom and Talents? who will remember the Beauty he hath once doted upon? who the ſumptuous Buildings he hath reared? who his acute and well-compoſed Writings? who his Diſcretion and Gravity in his diſcourſe? And if we ſhall forget what we our ſelves moſt valued and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, how ſhall we remember that of others? what remembrance ſhall there then be of the acts of that great <hi>Alexander?</hi> Of the Learning of <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> and the Endowments of the moſt renowned men of the world? Their Fame ſhall remain from thence forward for ever buried, and ſhall die with the World for a whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. The Mariners, when in ſome furious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt they are upon the point of ſinking, how are they amazed at the rage of the watry Element? how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and afflicted with the ruine which threatens them? what prayers and vows do they ſend up to Heaven? how diſintereſſed are they of all worldly matters, ſince they fling their wealth and riches into the Sea, for which they have run ſuch hazard? In what condition ſhall be then the Inhabitants of the Earth, when not onely the Sea with his raging, but Heaven and Earth with a thouſand prodigies ſhall affright them? when the Sun ſhall put on a Robe of mourning, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51068:103"/>amaze them with the horrour of his darkneſs: when the Moon ſhall look like blood, the Stars fall, and the Earth ſhake them with its unquiet trembling: when the Whirlwinds ſhall throw them off their legs, and frequent and thick flaſhes of Lightning dazle their ſight, and confound their underſtanding: what ſhall Sinners then do, for whoſe ſake all theſe fearful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall happen?</p>

                     <p>The fear and aſtoniſhment which ſhall fall upon mankind, when the whole power and concourſe of Nature ſhall be armed againſt Sinners, may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the fear which hath been cauſed by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of thoſe changes, which are foretold to happen in the end of the World altogether, and every one in great exceſs.

A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51068:104"/>morning the Heavens being firſt over-caſt with a dark Tempeſt, intermixt with frequent thunders, and horrid flaſhes of lightning, the whole body of the Earth moved, and the Sea being violently dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back retired in ſuch manner as the moſt hidden bottom of it was diſcovered; ſo as many unknown ſorts of Fiſhes were ſeen ſtretched out upon the mud. Thoſe vaſt profoundities beholding then the Sun, whom Nature from the beginning of the world had hid under ſo immenſe a maſs of waters, many Ships remained upon the Oaſe or floating in ſmall gullets: and Fiſhes were taken up with mens hands gaſping upon the dry ſands; but in ſhort time the waves of the Sea, inraged to ſee themſelves baniſht from their natural ſeats, lifted themſelves up with great fury againſt the Iſlands, and far extended Coaſts of the Continent; and what Cities or Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they encountred were violently overthrown and evened with the ground; in ſo much as the face of the World changed by the furious diſcord of the Elements produced many unheard of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. For the vaſt body of the waters ſuddenly and unexpectedly returning and entring far into the land, many thouſands of people were drowned, whoſe dead bodies, after the ſwellings of the waves were aſſwaged and retired unto their natural and uſual bed, were found, ſome with their faces down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grovling upon the Earth, ſome upwards look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Heavens; and ſome great Ships the waters left upon the tops of houſes, as it happened in <hi>Alexandria:</hi> others far from the Sea-ſhore, and as we our ſelves are witneſs, who ſaw one, as we paſſed by <hi>Methion,</hi> then old and worm-eaten.</q> All this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſtory is from <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No leſs fearful is that which is related by <hi>Nauclerus</hi> and <hi>Trithemius,</hi> that the year 1218.<note place="margin">Naucler. Gen. <hi>41.</hi> ſub fin. Trit.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51068:105"/>perſons. <hi>Langus</hi> adds; that afterwards in the year 1287. the Ocean again reentring the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, retired not till it had left 80000 perſons drowned behind it. This mortality is not much in a whole Province in reſpect of what the Sea hath done in one onely City. <hi>Surius</hi> in his Commentaries of the year 1509. writes, that the day of the Exaltation of the Croſs in <hi>September</hi> the Sea betwixt <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Pera</hi> ſwelled with that rage and fury, that it paſſed over the walls of both Cities, and that there were drowned onely of Turks in <hi>Couſtantinople</hi> above 13000. Unto theſe ſo certain examples we ſhall not need to aad what <hi>Plato</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Tertul. Apolog. Cap. <hi>39.</hi>
                        </note> although <hi>Tertullian</hi> and many Authors of theſe times approve it, That the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Iſland, which was ſeated in that ſpacious Ocean betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and which was a greater part of the World then <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrick</hi> both together, repleniſhed with innumerable people, was by an Earthquake, and the rain of one onely day and night, (in which the Heavens as it were melted themſelves into water) and the Sea over-paſt his bounds, buried in the Ocean with all the Inhabitants, and never ſince appeared. But I will not make uſe of this Hiſtory to exaggerate the force of the Elements enraged againſt man. The modern Stories, which we have related with more certainty, are ſufficient, and by that, which happened in <hi>Friſia,</hi> may be ſeen with what fury the Ocean impriſoned within his proper limits iſſues forth, when God permits it to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinners.

                     <p>The Air alſo, which is an Element ſo ſweet and gentle, in which we live, and by which we breath, when God ſlacking the bridle draws force out of weakneſs, with no leſs fury ruins and overthrows all it meets. It hath been ſeen to tear up whole woods

How ſhall it the be, when the Heavens and Air rain pieces of ſtars? The world was amazed when ill the time of <hi>Irene</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Sun was darkned for 17 dayes together, and in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Sun and Moon appeared not during the space of 12 dayes. What ſhall it be in the laſt dayes, when the Sun ſhall hide his beams under a mourning Garment, and the Moon ſhall cloath her ſelf with blood, to ſignifie the wanes which all the creatures are to make with fire and blood againſt thoſe who have deſpiſed their Creator? When on one ſide the Earth ſhall rouſe it ſelf up againſt them, and ſhall ſhake them off her back, as unwilling to endure their burthen any longer? When the Sea ſhall purſue and aſſault them within their own houſes, and the Air ſhall not permit them to be ſafe in the fields? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it ſhall be then no wonder, if they ſhall deſire the mountains to cover them, and the hills to hide them within their Caverns. But all this is rather to be imagined, then expreſſed; and the very thought of it is enough to make us tremble.

And if thoſe ſingle and alone were ſo terrible, (as we have already ſeen,) what ſhall they be when they come all together and from all parts; when the whole world ſhall rebel againſt man; when all ſhall be confuſion; when Summer ſhall be changed into Winter, and Winter into Summer, and no creature ſhall keep the prefixed law with them, who have not obſerved the Law of their Creatour, that ſo they may revenge both God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>

                     <p>But that this moſt fearful alteration of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſhall happen, may be yet more apparent, we will ſpecifie. ſome of them out of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> Very dreadful is that which he mentions in the eighth Chapter of hail, and fire, with a rain of blood, ſo general, and in ſuch abundance, that it ſhall deſtroy the third part of the Earth, of trees and green herbs. How horrible an amazement ſhall ſo general a rain cauſe amongſt men? But it is not ſo to end. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhall appear in the Air a huge mountain of fire, which ſhall fall all at once into the Sea, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf into ſeveral bodies ſhall burn the third part of the Fiſhes, the third part of Ships, and of what elſe ſhall be in the Ocean. The like effect ſhall proceed from a flame or prodigious Comet, which falling into the Rivers and Fountains, and there dividing it ſelf into ſeveral parts, ſhall turn the waters bitter as worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and make them ſo peſtilential, as they ſhall infect thoſe who drink them, and many ſhall die with their taſte. An Angel ſhall then ſmite the Sun, Moon, and Stars,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.</note> and deprive them of a third part of their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51068:107"/>light. But mote horrible than all, is that which follows; that after ſo many calamities the bottomleſs pit, which is hell, ſhall burſt open, and out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found throat belch forth ſo thick a ſmoke, as ſhall wholly darken the Sun and Air: from which ſmoke ſhall ſally forth a multitude of deformed Locuſts, which in great ſwarms ſhall diſperſe themſelves over the face of the whole earth, and leaving the fields, herbs, and what is ſown, fall upon ſuch men as have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful unto God, and ſhall for five moneths torment them with greater rage than Scorpions. Some Doctors underſtanding thoſe Locuſts according unto the Letter,<note place="margin">Leſſius de Perf. div. l. <hi>13.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi> Cornel. in Apoc.</note> that they ſhall be a certain kind of true Locuſts, but of a ſtrange figure and fierceneſs; others that they ſhall be Devils of hell in the ſhape of Locuſts; and it is no marvel, that in the deſtruction of the world Devils ſhall appear in viſible forms, ſince in the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> they appeared in divers figures of beaſts, as was propheſied by <hi>Iſaias.</hi> But after what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes that this Plague ſhall be ſo cruel,<note place="margin">Iſa. c. <hi>34.</hi> &amp; <hi>13.</hi>
                        </note> that men ſhall ſeek death, and ſhall not find it, and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhall flye from them.</p>
                     <p>Many other plagues ſhall happen in thoſe laſt dayes. For as before that God drowned the Aegyptians, and delivered his people, he ſent ſuch plagues upon Aegypt as are recorded in <hi>Exodus:</hi> ſo before the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sinners in that univerſal Deluge, and Sea of fire, which ſhall cover the whole Earth, and out of which the Saints are to eſcape free, ſo much greater plagues ſhall proceed, as the whole World is greater than <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For not onely the Rivers and Fountains ſhall then ce turned into blood, but the whole Sea ſhall be converted into a moſt black gore. The Lord ſhall alſo in thoſe days ſend horrible botches and ſores upon men; and the Sun ſhall ſcorch them in that manner, as they ſhall loſe their ſenſes, and ſome of the wicked ſhall turn againſt God, and blaſpheme as if they were
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51068:107"/>already in hell. The Earth alſo ſhall tremble; and that not being the greateſt which is recounted in the ſixth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> yet the Apoſtle relates ſuch things of it, as are able to ſtrike a fear and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into thoſe who hear it. His words are theſe. <hi>There was a great Earthquake;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>and the Sun became as ſackcloth, and the Moon at blood; the Stars fell from Heaven as a Fig-tree caſt off its green ſiggs, when it it ſhaken by a violent wind. The Heavens were folded up as a book, or as a roll of parchment: and all Mountains and Iſlands moved from their places.</hi> I leave unto the conſideration of every one, what ſhall then become of thoſe who remain alive in that conflict. St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes that Kings and Princes, the Rich and Strong, Slaves and Free-men ſhall hide themſelves in Caves, and Rocks, and ſhall ſay unto the Mountains and Hills, Fall upon us and cover us. And the ſame S. <hi>John</hi> ſayes further, that there ſhall be yet a greater Earthquake, which ſhall be the greateſt that ever happened ſince the foundation of the World was laid, in which the Iſlands ſhall ſink, and the Mountains ſhall be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Plains. Horrible lightnings and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall affright the Inhabitants of the Earth, and hailſtones ſhall fall of the weight of a Talent, which is of 5 Arrobas, an Hebrew Talent weighing 125 Roman pounds. This Plague joyned with ſo ſtrange an Earth-quake, how ſhall it aſtoniſh thoſe who are then alive?</p>

                     <p>But how ſhall it then fare with Sinners, when after all ſhall come that general fire ſo often foretold in holy Scripture, which ſhall either fall from Heaven,<note place="margin">Vide P.

What ſhall it then profit the wordlings to have rich Veſſels of gold and ſilver, curious Embroideries, precious Tapeſtries, pleaſant Gardens, ſumptuous Palaces, and all what the world now eſteems, when they ſhall with their own eyes behold their coſtly Moveables burnt, their rich and curious pieces of Gold melted, and their flouriſhing and pleaſant Orchards conſumed without power either to preſerve them or themſelves?

What lamentations were in <hi>Rome,</hi> when it burnt for ſeven dayes together? What ſhrieks were heard in <hi>Troy,</hi> when it was wholly conſumed with flames? What howling and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> when thoſe Cities were deſtroyed with fire from heaven?

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51068:110"/>burning of their Country, to ſtruggle with the water, and that which way ſoever they turned, they perceived death ſtill to follow them, and were certain to periſh? What ſhall be then the ſtreights and exigences of that general burning, when thoſe who ſhall eſcape Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, Inundations of the Sea, the fury of whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes and lightning from Heaven, ſhall fall into that univerſal Fire, that Deluge of flames, which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all, and make an end both of men and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories? Of thoſe who lived before the Flood, and were Maſters of the World for ſo long a time, except it be of ſome few, which the Scripture mention, we know nothing. Thoſe heroical actions, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſome of them performed, and gained by them incomparable fame, lye buried in the waters, and there remains no more memory of thoſe who did them, than if they had never been born. No more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſhall be the fame of thoſe, which now reſounds in the ears of the whole World, <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Hannibal, Scipio, Caeſar, Auguſtus, Plato, Ariſtotle, Hippocrates, Euclid,</hi> and the reſt: no more World, no more Fame. This Fire ſhall end all that ſmoke.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the World without convenient proportion to end in fire, which is now ſo full of ſmoke. There are few compariſons (as hath been ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this work) which expreſs better what the World is, than that which St. <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> learned of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, who ſaid the World was like a houſe full of ſmoke, which in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner blinds the eyes, as it differs not thoſe within it to ſee things as they are; and ſo the World with its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits ſo diſguiſes the nature of humane things, as we perceive not what they are. Ambition and humane honour (which the World ſo much dotes after) are no more than ſmoke without ſubſtance, which ſo blinds our underſtandings, that we know not the truth of that we ſo much covet. It is no marvail that ſo much ſmoke comes at laſt to end in flames. The ſmoke of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51068:110"/>the Mountains <hi>Veſuvius</hi> and <hi>Aetna,</hi> when it ends in fire , and burſts forth into thoſe innumerous flames, hath amazed the World, and rivers of fire have been ſeen to iſſue from their bowels.<note place="margin">Zon. In Tito. Proc. l. <hi>2.</hi>

                        <hi>Veſuvius</hi> is near unto <hi>Naples,</hi> and the fire hath ſometimes ſallyed forth with that impetuous violence, that, as grave Authors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the aſhes have been ſeen in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes,<note place="margin">St. Aug. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Civit. c. <hi>31.</hi>

With what fury ſhen ſhall the general Conflagration of the World burſt forth? that part, which ſhall iſſue forth of Hell, and from beneath the Earth, ſhall fill the World with aſhes before it be involved in flames; and when a crack of thunder or a flaſh of lightning ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes us ſo much, that fire which falls from heaven what violence and noiſe ſhall it bring along with it? <hi>Lot</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being ſecure in conſcience, and promiſed by the Angel of God, that for his ſake the City of <hi>Segor</hi> ſhould not be burnt, but that he might reſt ſafe in it, was notwithſtanding ſo affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fire which fell upon other Cities in that Valley of <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> that notwithſtanding he ſaw it not, yet he held himſelf not late, but retired unto the Mountains. What counſel ſhall ſinners take in that extremity, when their own Conſcience ſhall be their accuſors, and when they ſhall behold the World all on fire about them? whither ſhall they flye for ſafety, when no place will afford it? Shall they climb unto the Mountains? thither the flames will follow them. Shall they deſcend into the Valleys? thither the fire

                     <p>Beſides the contempt of all things, which the world eſteems, which we may draw from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſtruction of it by fire, we may alſo perceive the abomination of ſin: ſince God to purifie the World from that uncleanneſs, wherewith our offences have polluted it, is reſolved to cleanſe it with fire, as he anciently waſht it with the waters of the Deluge.

                        </note> But from this ſo terrible a fire the Saints then alive ſhall be free, that it may appear it was onely prepared for Sinners, and that nothing can then avail but vertue and holineſs.

                     <p> How the World ought to conclude with ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an end, in which a general Judgment is to paſs of all that is in it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO be ſubject to an end (as hath been ſaid) were ſufficient to breed in us a contempt of all things temporal; for what is to conclude in a not being, is already not much diſtant from it, and ſo differing little from nothing; ought not to be valued much more than if it were nothing. But unto this neceſſity of ending is annexed that ſo notable circumſtance of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after ſo dreadful and terrible a manner, as we have already ſeen. I have therefore been ſo full in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, that we may perceive by this ſo ſtrange a manner of concluſion, what our exorbitant malice in the abuſe of the Creatures hath added unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vanity; for it is we, who by our vices have made them of much leſs value, than they are by their own nature: ſo as in the condition they now ſtand they are much to be deſpiſed. Natural delights are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more pure, and leſs hurtful than humane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice hath made them, which hath rendred them more coſtly dangerous and difficult, and therefore leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; for what is ſubject to care and danger muſt of neceſſity be mixed with trouble. Honey loſes its
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51068:112"/>ſweetneſs if mixed with Gall, and the moſt generous Wine is corrupted with a little Vinegar; by which may appear the errour of our appetites, which ſtriving to augment our pleaſures hath leſſened them, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inordinate reliſhes to what nature had ſimply and regularly provided, hath rather invented new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions than contents. Our gluttony is not pleaſed with ſavoury food, but what we eat muſt be rare and coſtly: it contents not it ſelf with the bare taſte of meat, which is its proper object, but ſeeks after ſmell and colour; it is not Cooked, if not diſguiſed, neither will that ſerve, if not accommodated with ſeveral ſorts of Spices. Salt and Sugar ſeaſons not what we eat, but Musk and Amber. Neither is our feeling content with the warmth of our Apparel, but looks after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, faſhion, and expence; and we are more ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous that it may appear neat and curious unto others, than that it may decently cover and cheriſh our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated members, taking occaſion by the neceſſity of nature to nouriſh our vices, Apparel ſerving rather the ambition and pride of our mindes, than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of our bodies.</p>
                  <p>But it is not much that we content not our ſelves with the natural uſe of things, ſince we are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with nature it ſelf, but adulterate it with art; not onely women, but men dye their hair, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their faces and ſtatures, and the Creature to the injury of the Creatour preſumes to form himſelf after another manner, than God thought fit to make him. In like manner riches are not meaſured out for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane neceſſity and conveniency, but for pomp and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy: in the acquiſition and uſe whereof we look not ſo much what ſuffices for life, and the lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it, as what ſerves for pride and oſtentation, wherein conſuming our wealth and fortunes we loſe the uſe of them, and what was onely ordained as a remedy of our neceſſities, by our abuſe augment and make them greater: Whereupon it commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51068:112"/>that rich men are moſt in want, and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages are more indebted and engaged than meaner people. Honour and Fame are ſo adulterated, that they are not onely deſired as a reward of vertues, but of vices. All theſe abuſes are the faults of the World, which hath made humane life more troubleſome and full of danger, than it is by neceſſity and condition; and therefore it was convenient that the World ſhould end with trouble and confuſion, ſince the abuſe of it hath been with ſo much ſhame and impudence: and that it ſelf alſo ſhould be judged, which hath ſuſtained and fed the vanity and folly of man with things ſo baſe and deſpicable. The ancient Philoſophers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vertue and the felicity of man in living according unto nature; but what content and happineſs can there be, when all the pleaſures of life are ſo ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with art, as they are wholly different from that which nature requires? and what vertue can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, who live according to ſo much malice? But Chriſtians, who ought not onely to live conformable to nature, but unto grace and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, make it apparent how juſt it is, that the wicked ſhould give an account of thoſe things, which they have uſed ſo contrary unto his divine pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>And ſo not onely thoſe things, which are ſpoken of in the precedent Chapter, are to be of terrour and fear in the end of the World, but more eſpecially that ſtrict account which God ſhall then exact from the whole Linage of man. For as in the death of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons there is to be a particular judgement, ſo in the death of the World a general Judgement is to paſs upon all; and as the moſt terrible thing of death is that particular reckoning, ſo in the end of the World is that univerſal reckoning, when God ſhall

The manifeſtation of which truth will be of more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto the wicked than all the plagues and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of Earthquakes, Inundations, Tempeſts, Locuſts, Peſtilences, Famines, Warres, Lightnings and Fire, which have gone before.<note place="margin">Guigo Carth. in med.</note> Therefore <hi>Guigo Carthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaid well, that the moſt terrible thing of that day was the truth, that ſhould then appear againſt Sinners.

It was therefore moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that after the particular Judgement of each man apart there ſhould be an univerſal Judgement of all together, in which God ſhould make appear the righteouſneſs of his proceedings, and give a general ſatisfaction of his juſtice even to the damned and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.

The fame and memory of Man after death doth not oftentimes correſpond unto the deſerts of his life, and it is juſt that this deceit ſhould be taken off; and that the vertuous, whom the World made no account of, ſhould then be acknowledged for ſuch, and he who had fame and glory without merit, ſhould then change it into ſhame and confuſion.</p>

                     <p>The ſame, which is to paſs in Fame and Memory, is alſo to paſs in Children, in whom, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">St. Thom. ſupra.</note> the Fathers live: and as from many good Parents ſpring evil Children, ſo contrariwiſe from evil Parents come thoſe that are good, which ſhall be in that day a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to thoſe who begat them, and by ſo much the greater, by how much worſe was the example which they gave them. Neither ſhall the Judge onely enquire into the example they have given their Children, but alſo unto ſtrangers, and principally the works which they have left behind them. And therefore as from the deceit of <hi>Arius</hi> (ſaith the Angelical Doctor) and other Heretiques have and ſhall ſpring divers Errours and Hereſies until the end of the World: ſo it is fit that in that laſt day of time ſhould appear the evil which hath been occaſioned by them, that we may in this life not onely take a care for our ſelves but others; ſo as it is a terrible thing (as <hi>Cajetan</hi> notes upon that Article before mention'd of the Angelical Doctor,) that the Divine judgement ſhall extend even to thoſe things which are by accident, which is, as the Divines ſpeak, unto thoſe which are beſides our will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo informs us, That by reaſon of the body, which remains after death, it was convenient that the ſentence of each one in particular ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated in that general Judgement of the whole
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51068:115"/>World: Becauſe many Bodies of juſt men are now bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the mawes of wild Beaſts, or otherwiſe remain without interrement; and to the contrary great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have had ſumptuous Burials and magnificent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, all which are to be recompenſed in that day of the Lord; and the ſinner, whoſe Body repoſed in a rich <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> ſhall then ſee himſelf not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ornaments and Beauty, but tormented with into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pains; and the juſt, who died and had no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, but were devoured by ravenous Birds, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with the brightneſs of the Heavens, and with a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy glorious as the Sun. Let thoſe conſider this, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume vaſt ſums in preparing for themſelves ſtately Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, and beautiful Urns, engraving their Names, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Dignities in rich Marbles, and let them know that all this, if they ſhall be damned, ſhall ſerve them in that day but for their greater ſhame and reproach. Out of this life we can carry nothing but our good works, and let us not add unto our evil ones that of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory in ſeeking to leave behind us a vain Fame and Renown.<note place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>56.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
                        </note> What remains unto King <hi>Porſenna</hi> of that heavy burthen, wherewith he grieved and afflicted his whole Kingdom, in rearing him a Sepulchre of that rare and ſumptuous workmanſhip, but a teſtimony of his pride and folly? In like manner the Monument of the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> which was the Beauty and Glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall be then changed into a ſcorn. Laſtly St. <hi>Thomas</hi> teaches us, that Temporal things, on which we place our affections, becauſe ſome laſt a longer, and ſome a ſhorter time, after death ſhall all enter with us into Divine judgement. Let us take heed therefore whereon we ſet our hearts, ſince the accompliſhing of what we wiſh may be a puniſhment of our deſires. Thoſe things of the Earth, which we moſt love, and deſire ſhould continue, if they be taken from us, it is a chaſtiſement of our earthly affection: and if we be permitted to enjoy them, let us fear that they be not the temporal Reward of ſome good Work, which may
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51068:115"/>either diminiſh or deprive us of the Eternal. Beſides this becauſe not onely the Soul of man hath offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the whole man both in Soul and Body, it was fit that both Soul and Body ſhould be judged and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Tribunal of Chriſt, and that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, becauſe none ſhould preſume to ſin in ſecret, ſince his ſins are to be revealed and made known to all, paſt, preſent, and to come. A terrible caſe it is, that this paſſage of Divine judgement, which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we have ſaid out of holy <hi>Job</hi>) appears unto the Saints more terrible than to ſuffer all the pains of Hell, is twice to be acted, and this ſo bitter trance to be again repeated the ſecond time, being unto ſinners of greater horrour and confuſion than the firſt.</p>

                  <p>THat we may now come to handle the manner of this univerſal Judgement, which is to paſs upon time and men, we are to ſuppoſe that this fire, which is to precede the coming of Chriſt, is at his deſcent to continue in aſſiſtance of his Divine juſtice, and after his return unto Heaven attended by all the juſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until it hath purged and purified theſe inferiour Elements; the which is noted by <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi>

                     </note> and collected from divers places of the Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We are alſo to ſuppoſe that this coming of Chriſt is to be with greater terrour and Majeſty, than hath been yet manifeſted by any of the Divine perſons, either in himſelf or any of his Creatures. If an Angel which repreſented God, and was onely to promulgate the Law, came with that terrour and Majeſty unto Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> as made the Hebrew people, though pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and prepared for his coming, to quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; what ſhall the Lord of the Law doe, when he himſelf comes to take an account of the Law, and to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51068:116"/>revenge the breach of it? With what terrour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall he appear unto men plunged in ſin, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for his reception, who are then to be all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and judged in that laſt day of time?</p>
                  <p>The day in which the Law was given was very memorable unto the Hebrews: And this day, where an account of the Law is to be given, will be horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ought perpetually to remain in the memory of all mankind. But before we declare what ſhall paſs in this, let us ſay ſomething of what hath already paſſed in that, that from the horrour of the firſt appearance we may gather ſomething of what ſhall happen in the ſecond, and from the Majeſty, wherewith an Angel appeared when he gave the Law, collect ſomething of the Majeſty of the Lord of Angels when he judges the Law. Fifty dayes after the departure of the Sons of Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after ſo many plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments poured upon that Kingdom, after the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the unbelieving <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who purſued them, in the bottom of the Red Sea, and that the Hebrews having eſcaped their enemies were lodged round about Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi>

For after the ſending far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er plagues than thoſe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after burning in that Deluge of fire the Sinners of the world, the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill alive, that that Article of our Faith may be literally fulfill'd, <hi>From thence he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead,</hi> The Heavens ſhall open, and over the Valley of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> the Redeemer of the World, attended by all the Angels of Heaven in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forms of admirable ſplendour ſhall with a Divine Majeſty deſcend to judge it.

The Souls alſo of thoſe, who died onely in Original ſin, ſhall come and poſſeſs again their bodies free from pain or torment; and the Souls of the bleſſed filling their bodies with the four gifts of Glory, ſhall make them more reſplendent than the Sun: and with the gift of agility ſhall joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

If we are now ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible when people murmure at us, or that ſome infamous act of ours is known to one or two perſons, how ſhall we be then troubled when all our faults together are made known unto all, both men and Angels? How many are there now, who if they imagined that their father or brother knew what they had committed in ſecret, would die with grief? And yet in that day not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51068:120"/>onely fathers and brothers, but friends and enemies, and all the world ſhall to their confuſion know it. The virtuous actions of the juſt how ſecretly ſoever performed, their holy thoughts, their pious deſires, their pure intentions, their good works, which the world now either diſeſteems, or calumniates as mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall then be manifeſted, and they for them ſhall be honoured by the whole world; virtue ſhall then appear admirable in all her beauty, and vice horrible in all her deformity. It ſhall then be ſeen how decent and beautiful it is for the great to humble themſelves, for the offended to be ſilent, and pardon injuries: on the other ſide, how inſolent and horrid a thing it is to trample upon the poor, to wrong the humble, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire revenge, and Lord it over others. Then ſhall be alſo diſcovered the good works of the wicked, but for their greater affront, in that they have not perſevered in doing well: and that calling to remembrance the good counſel and advice which they have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, which hath been a means of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be now confounded to have neglected it themſelves to their own damnation. The ſins alſo of the juſt ſhall be publiſhed, but with all their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the good which they have drawn from their faults, in ſuch ſort as it ſhall no ways redound to their ſhame, but be an argument of rendring thanks and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine praiſes to the Lord, who was pleaſed to pardon them. But nothing ſhall be of greater deſpite and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto ſinners, than to behold thoſe, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted equal &amp; greater ſins than themſelves, to be then in Glory, becauſe they made uſe of the time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which they deſpiſed and neglected. This confuſion ſhall be augmented by that inward charge which God ſhall lay againſt them of his divine benefits, unto which their Angel guardians ſhall aſſiſt by giving teſtimony how often they have diſſwaded them from their evil courſes, and how rebellious and refractory they have ſtill been to their holy inſpirations.

Nothing is exempted from death, and therefore not onely humane life, but all things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low time, and even time it ſelf at laſt muſt die. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Heſichius,</hi>

                     </note> as he is tranſlated by St. <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> ſaith, That the ſplendour of this world is but as wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered leaves, bubles of water, ſmoke, ſtubble, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and duſt driven by the wind: all things that are of earth being to end in earth. But this is not all; for beſides the certainty of end, they are infected with another miſchief, which renders them much more
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51068:123"/>contemptible than that, which is their inſtability, and continual changes, whereunto they are ſubject even whileſt they are. For as time it ſelf is in a perpetual ſucceſſion and mutation, as being the brother and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion of Motion, ſo it fixes this ill condition unto moſt of thoſe things which paſs along in it, the which not onely have an end, and that a ſhort one, but even during that ſhortneſs of time, which they laſt, have a thouſand changes, and before their end many ends, and before their death many deaths, each particular change, which our life ſuffers, being the death of ſome eſtate or part of if. For as death is the total change of life, ſo every change is the death of Come part. Sickneſs is the death of health, ſleeping of waking, ſorrow of joy, impatience of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, youth of infancy, and age of youth. The ſame condition hath the univerſal world and all things in it; for which cauſe they deſerve ſo much contempt, that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperour wondered that there could be found a man ſo ſenſeleſs,<note place="margin">Aur. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. l. <hi>6.</hi> de vita ſua.</note> as to value them; and therefore ſpeaks in this manner. <q>Of that very thing, which is now in doing, ſome part is already vaniſht: changes and alterations continually innovate the world, as that immenſe ſpace of time by a perpetual flux renews it ſelf. Who therefore ſhall eſteem thoſe things which never ſubſiſt, but paſs along in this headlong and precipitate river of time, is as he who ſets his affection upon ſome little bird, which paſſes along in the air, and is no more ſeen.</q> Thus much from this Philoſopher. This very cauſe of the little value of things temporal proceeding from their perpetual changes, together with the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are ſubject, is, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> notes, ſignified unto us by that Woman in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Greg. l. <hi>34.</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> who had the Moon under her feet, and her head adorned with twelve Stars. Certainly the Moon, as well as the Stars, might have been placed in her Diadem: but it was trod under foot by reaſon of the continual changes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51068:124"/>and alterations which it ſuffers, whereby it becomes a figure of things temporal, which change not onely every Moneth, but every day; the ſame day being, as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſayes, now a Mother, then a Stepmother. The ſame was alſo ſignified by the Angel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10.</note> who crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Rainbow deſcended from heaven to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that all time was to end; with his right foot, which preſſes and treads more firmly, he ſtood upon the Sea, which by reaſon of its great unquietneſs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a figure of the inſtability of this World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with much reaſon did the Angel, who had taught us by his voice, that all time and temporal things were to have an end, ſhew us alſo by this ſigne, that for their inſtability and inconſtancy they were even before their end to be trodden under foot and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But more lively is the ſame expreſt by the ſame St. <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. <hi>15.</hi> Ribera &amp; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</note> when he beheld the Saints ſtanding upon the Sea, to note that whileſt they lived they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and trampled under foot the tranſitory and fading things of this World; and to declare it more fully he ſayes, the Sea was of glaſs, then which nothing is more frail, and although hard yet brittle.</p>
                  <p>Needs muſt the inſtability of things temporal be very great, and therefore moſt deſpicable, becauſe it proceeeds from ſo many cauſes. For as the Sea hath two ſeveral kinds of motion, the firſt natural, by which it riſeth and falleth daily with continual ebbs and flows, ſo as the waves, when they are moſt quiet, are yet ſtill moving and inconſtant: the other violent, when the waters are raiſed and incenſed by ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tempeſt; in the ſame manner the things of this World are naturally of themſelves fading and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and without any exteriour violence ſuffer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual change; and run rowling on toward their end; but beſides are alſo ſubject to other unthought of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and extraordinary violences, which force na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of her courſe, and raiſe huge ſtorms in the Sea of this life, by which thoſe things, which we moſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51068:124"/>eſteem, ſuffer ſhipwrack. For as the faireſt flower wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it ſelf, yet is oftentimes before born away by the wind, or periſhes by ſome ſtorm of hail, The moſt exact beauties loſe their luſtre by age, but are often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blaſted by ſome violent Feaver, The moſt coſtly Garments wear out in time, if before not taken from us by the Theef, The ſtrongeſt and moſt ſumptuous Palaces decay with continuance, if before not ruined by Fire or Earthquakes: In like manner both their own nature and extrinſecal violences deprive tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things even of time it ſelf, and trail them along in perpetual changes, leaving nothing ſtable.

And yet the holy Scripture deſcribes <hi>Ecbatana</hi> the chief City of <hi>Media</hi> to be more ſtrong than that. It was built by <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> of ſquare ſtone: the Walls contained ſeventy cubits in breadth, thirty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in height, and the Towers, which encompaſſed it, were each in height a hundred cubits; and yet for all this could not the <hi>Median</hi> Empire, having ſuch a head, eſcape from rendring it ſelf unto the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> And the ſame Monarch, who built it, and made the World to tremble under him, came to loſe it and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and having conquered many Nations, became at laſt conquered and a Slave unto his enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is not much that Cities have ſuffered ſo many changes, ſince Monarchies and Empires have done the ſame: and ſo often hath the World changed her face, as ſhe hath changed her Monarch and Maſter. He who had ſeen the World as it was in the time of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> would not have known it as it was in the time of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and he who knew it in the time of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> would not have judged it for the ſame when the <hi>Greeks</hi> were Maſters. After in the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> it appeared with a face not known before: and he who knew it then would not know it now; and ſome years hence it will put on another form, being in nothing more like it ſelf than in its perpetual changes and alterations; for which cauſe it hath been ever worthy of ſcorn and contempt, and more now than ever,<note place="margin">Cyp. in Epiſt. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> ſince it becomes every day worſe, and grows old, and decayes with age, as St, <hi>Cyprian</hi> notes in thoſe words: <q>Thou art to know that the World is already grown old, and doth not remain in that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51068:125"/>ſtrength and vigour which it had at firſt. This the World it ſelf tells us, and the daily declining of it into worſe needs no other teſtimony. The Winter wants the uſual rains to fertilize the earth; the Summer the accuſtomed heat to ripen the corn; the Autumn is not loaden as heretofore with fruits, nor the Spring glads us with the delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its ſweet temperature; out of the hollowed Mountains are drawn leſs pieces of marble; and the exhauſted Mines yield leſs quantities of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The Labourer is wanting in the Fields, the Mariners in the Seas, the Souldier in the Tents, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in the Market-places, Juſtice in the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Sincerity in Friendſhip, Skill in Arts, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in Manners. Neceſſary it is, that that ſhould decay, which thus daily ſinks into it ſelf, and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches towards an end. Immediately he adds; This is the doom of the World, This the ordinance of God; all that is born muſt die; all that increaſes muſt grow old, the ſtrong become feeble, the great diminiſh, and when diminiſhed periſh. Anciently our lives extended beyond 800 or 900 years: now few arrive unto an hundred. We ſee boys grown gray, and our age ends not in decrepit years, but then begins: and in our very birth we draw near our ends, and he who is now born, with the age of the World degenerates. Let no man therefore marvel that the parts of the World decay, ſince the whole goes to ruine.</q> Neither is the World onely grown worſe in the natural frame of it, but is alſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in the moral; the manners of men have altered it more, than the violences and encounters of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Empire of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> much corrupted the primitive ſimplicity and innocence of it; and what they wanted was effected by the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and wherein they failed, by the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and wherein they, by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and wherein they, is abundantly made up by us; For the pride of Monarchs is the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51068:126"/>and deſtruction of good manners. And therefore unto the four Monarchies may be fitly applyed that which was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi>

The natural Philoſophers obſerve three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the Moon, pale, red, and white; the firſt foreſhews rain, the ſecond wind, and the third chears up with hopes of fair weather. In the ſame, manner is the heart of man changed by three moſt violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections repreſented by thoſe three colours. That of pale the colour of gold, coveting riches more frail and ſlippery than waters; That of red the colour of purple, gaping after the wind of vain honours; The laſt of white the colour of mirth and jollity, running after the guſts and pleaſures of this life. With theſe three affections Man is in perpetual change and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as there are ſome Plants which follow the courſe of the Moon, ſtill turning and moving accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her courſe, ſo theſe alterations in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections draw after them, and are the cauſe of theſe great changes and revolutions, which happen in the World. How many Kingdoms were overthrown by the covetouſneſs of <hi>Cyrus?</hi> The ambition of <hi>Alexander</hi> did not onely deſtroy a great part of the World, but
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51068:126"/>made it put on a clear other face than it had before. What part of <hi>Troy</hi> was left ſtanding by the laſcivious love of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was not onely the ruine of <hi>Greece,</hi> but ſet on fire his own Countrey? That which time ſpares is often ſnatcht away by the covetouſneſs of the Theef: and how many lives are cut off by revenge, before they arrive unto old age? There is no doubt but humane affections are thoſe fierce winds which trouble the Sea of this World: and as the Ocean ebbs and flows according to the courſe of the Moon, ſo the things of this life conform their motions unto humane paſſions. There is no ſtability in any thing, and leaſt in man, who is not onely changeable in himſelf, but changes all things beſides.</p>

It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that near that place a certain Malefactor was executed, and leſt his kindred ſhould by night ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Body and give it burial, a Souldier was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to watch it, who being weary, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that not far off the Widow was encloſed in the Sepulcher, reſolved for a time to quit his charge, and trye what entertainment he could find with her.

In the mean time whileſt the Souldier tranſported with his pleaſure forgot his duty, the friends of the executed Malefactor ſtole away the Body: which being perceived by the Souldier, who now ſatiate with his dalliance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto his guard, and knowing his offence to be no leſs than capital, he repairs with great fear and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement

                        <hi>Philo</hi> conſidering and admiring ſo great vanity and change,<note place="margin">Philo. l. de Joſ.</note> ſpeaks after this manner. <q>Perhaps thoſe things which concern the Body are they not dreams? perhaps this momentary beauty does it not wither even before it flouriſh? our health is uncertain, expoſed to ſo many infirmities: a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand griefs happening by divers occaſions abate our ſtrength and forces: the quickneſs and vigour of our ſenſes are corrupted by vitious humours. Who then can be ignorant of the baſeneſs of exteriour things? One day often makes an end of great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: many Perſonages of great honour and eſteem changing their fortune become infamous: great Empires and Kingdoms have in a ſhort time been ruined. Of this <hi>Dionyſius</hi> is a ſufficient witneſs, who thruſt from his Throne from a King of <hi>Sicily</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a School-maſter in <hi>Gorinth,</hi> and taught boyes.

Since therefore we eſteem things preſent but as a dream, and we our ſelves to be but as in a Inn, from whence we are ſodainly to depart, let us take care for our journey, and furniſh our ſelves with proviſion, and a <hi>Viaticum</hi> for eternity; let us cloath our ſelves with ſuch garments, as we may carry along with us. For as no man can lay hold on his Shadow, ſo no man retains things humane, which partly in death, and partly before death fly from us, and run more ſwiftly than a rapid river. To the contrary are thoſe things which are to come, which neither ſuffer age, nor change, nor are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to revolutions, but perpetually flouriſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in a continued felicity. Take heed then of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring thoſe riches which remain not with their Maſters, but change in every inſtant, and leap from one to another, and from this to that. It behooves thee to deſpiſe all thoſe things, and to eſteem them as nothing.</q> Let it ſuffice to hear what the Apoſtle ſayes; <hi>The things that are ſeen are temporal, but thoſe which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> Things humane diſappear more ſodainly than a ſhadow.</p>

Who ſees not here thoſe ſecret pipes by which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are derived, and fortune changed? <hi>Marcus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the dignity of a Praetor, was ſodainly after a Slave, than a Friend of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and a redeemer of his redeemer, arriving at higher preferments by his ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and captivity, than by his birth and former digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whileſt life laſts there is no miſhap without hope: and affliction, although we look upon things within their own limits and natural diſpoſition, come often home loaden with proſperities. But if we look upon them with that divine hope, which we ought to have, there is no evil from whence we may not derive a good. To what greater ſtreights can one be brought than to be drawn forth to execution, and held guilty by the conſent of all, as <hi>Suſanna</hi> was? but in the very way to juſtice God raiſed her up a ſalvation both of life and honour, converting her unjuſt infamy into a great eſteem and admiration of her vertue. What remedy for <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was thrown into a Cave amongſt hungry Lions? but where he expected to be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wild beaſts, he found comfort. The three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who were caſt into the fiery Furnace in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where there was nothing to be hoped for but death, found refreſhment, life, and content. <hi>David,</hi> when he was compaſſed in by the Souldiers of <hi>Saul,</hi> deſpaired of ſafety, yet eſcaped the danger. There is no evil in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51068:130"/>this life, which even with the hopes of this life may not be aſſwaged: but with the hopes of the other who will not be comforted? Let us therefor onely fear eternal evils, which have neither comfort, hope, nor poſſibility of amendment.</p>

There is no fortune ſo high, unto which may not ſucceed a condition as low and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.

Let the Popes confider that ſome of them have been forced to kiſs the feet of other Popes. Theſe things ſeem incredible, and mortals are hardly drawn to believe them. But let no man wonder at the ſucceſs of any, ſince not only Kings, Emperours, and Popes have been condemned, but Saints, and ſuch, who by their holineſs have wrought miracles, have fallen and been danmed in hell fire!

                  <p>Who would imagine that ſo opprobrious affronts could befal a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour as happened to <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus?</hi> whoſe hiſtory I ſhall here relate to confirm that, which, if grave Authors had not reported, would ſeem incredible.<note place="margin">An. <hi>1285.</hi> Nicetas Chroniat. in annal. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Nicetas</hi> writes, and others bear him witneſs, That this Emperour in the third year of his reign was laid hold upon by his own Vaſſals; a ſtrong chain and collar of iron, as if he had been ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive dog, faſtned about his neck: his hands manacled, and his feet fetter'd with heavy ſhackles: the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort of people taunting him with bitter ſcoffs buffetted him upon the face, punched him upon the body, pluckt his beard from his chin, drew him up and down by the hair of his head, knockt out his teeth, and for his greater affront ſcourged him on thoſe parts, where they uſe to whip children. After which they brought him into the publick Market-place, that all that would might abuſe him: and even women buffetted him; which done they cut off hs right hand, hurried him into priſon, and flung him into the common-hole, where the moſt notorious Theeves and Murtherers were lodged, leaving him nothing to feed on, or ſo much as any to give him a jarre of water. From thence ſome few dayes after they drew him forth, pluckt out one of his eyes, mounted him naked (ſaving a little ſhort cloak which covered nothing almoſt of his body) upon a lean ſcabbed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, his face backward, holding the tayl in his hand inſtead of a Scepter, and a halter in place of a Diadem. In this equipage they brought him again into the Market-place, where the injuries, ſcorns, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies put upon him by the raſcal multitude are not imaginable. Some caſt onions and rotten fruit at him, others prickt him in the ſides with ſpits, others ſtufft his noſtrils with filth and dung, others ſqueezed upon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51068:131"/>his head and face ſponges filled with urin and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſome flung ſtones and dirt at him, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by moſt opprobrious names; and there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not an impudent baggage, who running into the Kitchen fetcht a pot of ſcalding water and threw in his face. There was no Tapſter, Cobler, Tinker, or baſe Tradeſman, which found not out ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affront him. At laſt they hung him by the heels betwixt two pillars, and there left him to die. But then did not his own Courtiers and houſhold Servants pardon him; one thruſt his ſword up to the hilts in his bowels: two others, to prove which had the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſword, tried them in his fleſh. At laſt the miſerable Emperour (although moſt happy if he were ſaved) brought with much adoe that arm, which had loſt the hand and yet ran with blood, to moiſten his drie mouth, and ſo expired. In this manner ended the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Eaſt: but not yet his ignominy; for during three dayes after they ſuffered his dead body to hang upon the Gibbet, which was at laſt taken down more to free the living from horrour, than for compaſſion to the dead, whom they buried like a mad dog. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in this glaſs behold and conſider what the things of this life are. Let him compare <hi>Andronicus</hi> with <hi>Andronicus, Andronicus</hi> Emperour and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> with <hi>Andronicus</hi> a Priſoner and publickly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; behold him firſt cloathed in Purple, adored by Nations, commanding the Eaſt, his temples encircled with a Royal Diadem, the Imperial Scepter in his hands, and his very ſhooes ſtuddied with Oriental U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; Then look upon him inſulted over by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of his people, buffetted by women, and pelted with dirt and ſtones in his Imperial City. Who would believe that he, whom the people thronged to look upon as upon ſome God when he paſſed through the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in his Royal Chariot, covered with plates of burniſht gold, guarded with excellent Captains, and waited on by the Princes of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51068:132"/>ſhould by thoſe very ſame perſons, who ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had taken their oaths of loyalty, and ſworn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, be ſo traiterouſly and barbarouſly handled? Finally, he who had commanded juſtice to paſs upon ſo many, ſhould himſelf come to be juſtized with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infamy than any of them? who could imagine that one ſubject ſhould be ſo ſodainly capable of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent extremes, and that ſo great glory ſhould conclude in ſo much ignominy? This is enough to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all temporal goods and humane felicity, which not onely paſſes away with time, but often changes into greater misfortunes. What eſteem can that merit which ſtands expoſed to ſo much miſery: which is by ſo much more ſenſible to the ſufferer, by how much it was leſs expected? To this may be added another conſideration of no ſmall profit, That if this Emperour paſſed to his ſalvation through ſo many affronts and cruel torments, what hurt did they do him? what imports it that he was ſo unhappy in this life, if he were happy in the other? certainly he gave ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient hopes of his contrition; for in all that lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and never to be paralell'd Tragedy no ſign of impatience ever appeared in him, neither ſpake he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words than theſe, <hi>Lord have mercy on me;</hi> and when they abuſed and wounded him with ſo much cruelty, all he ſaid was this, <hi>Why do ye break this brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reed?</hi> Certainly, if he knew how to benefit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (as it ſeems he did) by his miſery, he was more happy in it, than in his Empire. The eternal is that which imports. As for the glory of his Empire, and the miſery of his ignominy, they are now paſt.</p>
                  <p>A greater Emperour was <hi>Vitellius</hi> than he,<note place="margin">Fulgoſ. l. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> ſince not only the Eaſt, but Weſt acknowledged him for the Lord and Monarch of the whole World. The riches he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed were beyond eſtimation, and gold abounded with him, as ſtones of the Streets with others. In <hi>Rome</hi> he was acknowledged <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſaluted with ſo glorious titles, that he ſeemed to be all he could deſire
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51068:132"/>leſs than a God. But wherein ended all this Majeſty, but in the greateſt infamy that can be imagined? for having tyed a rope about his neck, and his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, torn his garments from his back, and ſtuck a dagger under his chin, they haled him ignominiouſly up and down the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> caſt filth in his face, and reviled him with a thouſand injurious ſpeeches, and at laſt killed him in the Market-place, and threw him down the <hi>Gemonies,</hi> where they uſed to fling the bodies of ſuch offenders as were not lawfully to be buried. A ſtrange caſe, to what end ſome men are born, ſuch care, trouble and circumſpection in bringing on a life to conclude in ſo diſaſtrous a death. He who ſhould know the ends of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and ſhould behold their birth, breeding, ſtudies, pretences, and recreations, ſhould ſee them clad in ſilk and gold, and acknowledged Emperours, Would he ſay in his heart, that ſo much adoe was neceſſary for ſuch an end? Folly is all humane greatneſs, ſince at laſt it muſt end, and perhaps in ſo diſaſtrous a concluſion. With reaſon did <hi>Pachimeras</hi> ſay; It was ſafer to truſt to a ſhadow, than to humane happineſs. Who could imagine that the Emperour <hi>Valerianus,</hi>

Compare here the different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may happen to a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour: Behold <hi>Valerianus</hi> mounted upon a brave Courſer, trapped with Gold, clad in Purple, crowned with the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diadem, adored by Nations, and commanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Kingdoms: and after ſee the ſame man encloſed like a beaſt, and trodden under the foot of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King. Such contrary fortunes happen in humane life. Let us not therefore truſt in it.</p>

                     <p>Yet leſs imaginable ſeems that which happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pope <hi>John</hi> the XXIII. when after four years poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Papacy, many Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> having during that time in token of obedience kiſſed his feet, he himſelf came to kiſs the feet of another Pope; and having in his Pontificat created many Cardinals, took it at laſt as a ſingular favour to be made one himſelf. This ſeems incredible; but it is a moſt true hiſtory. The mutability of humane things produces ſo ſtrange effects, that our imagination dares not feign them. Who would think that the chief Biſhop ſhould be made a Captive, as this was in the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> aſſembled for the pacification of the Schiſme then reigning in the Church? There he was deprived of his dignity, and himſelf confirmed his own depoſition, and ſuffered in perſon great miſery, want, and affliction; from whence he made an eſeape, and fled from place to place, until at length he became ſo well adviſed as to put himſelf into the hands of <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth, elected after his depoſition, who had many Cardinals then about him created by this <hi>John,</hi> who beheld him, that had made them, deprived of all dignities, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly asking pardon of the new Pope, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for ſuch., and eſteemed it a great favour to receive his Hat anew. Thus far can the inſtability of Temporal goods arrive. Who could imagine that which happened unto the Emperour <hi>Zeno,</hi> who after he had poſſeſſed the Empire many years, cockered in all the blandiſhments of ſo high a fortune, was at laſt conſtrained through famine to eat his cloathes, and feed upon the fleſh of his own armes? This Emperour being in a trance was given out to be dead, and ſo buried in a Vault, but returning afterwards unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he cried out aloud; named thoſe of his Guard and his other Servants, who, though they heard him, would

                     <p>What we have hitherto recounted are changes, not falls. That which we are to fear is a fall from ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vertue, and this is properly to fall, when we deſcend from the ſtate of grace to that of ſin. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of fortune are but exchanges of one condition for another. No man can fall when he is at loweſt; and the loweſt and baſeſt of all things is humane felicity, which when it quits us, we fall not, but change it, and perhaps for the better. The true falls are thoſe which are ſpiritual; and it may with reaſon amaze us, to ſee that on this part alſo we are expoſed to uncertainties. But this may be our comfort, that temporal changes are not in our hands, but ſpiritual are. Our wealth, whether we will or no, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us, but grace unleſs by our own fault can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. We may be bereaved of honours againſt our will, but not of vertue except we conſent. Corporal goods may periſh, be ſtoln, and loſt a thouſand manner of wayes: but ſpiritual goods can onely be forſaken, and are then onely loſt, when we leave them by ſin. This may make us tremble, that they are loſt becauſe we will loſe them, and not being mutable in themſelves they change becauſe we are mutable. That which hath happened in this kind is moſt lamentable. St. <hi>Peter Damian</hi> writes that he knew a Monk in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Benevento,</hi> named <hi>Madelmo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Petr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note> who arrived at ſo great ſanctity of life, that being upon a holy Saturday to fill a dozen of Lamps, and oyl failing for the luſt, he with great faith filled it with water, and lighting it, it burned as the reſt. Many other miracles he wrought in our Lord, for which he was in great eſteem both of the Prince and Citizens. But wherein ended this miraculous and venerable man? a ſtrange change. God withdrawing his holy hand from him, he fell into ſuch diſhoneſty of life, that he was taken and publickly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51068:135"/>whipt, and his head for his greater ignominy ſhaved like a Slave. A lamentable tragedy is the life of man, wherein we behold ſo contrary extremes.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> The ſame St. <hi>Peter Damian</hi> writes, that he knew in the ſame City a Prieſt of ſo great ſanctity, that every day, when he celebrated Maſs, the Prince of <hi>Benevento</hi> beheld an Angel deſcend from heaven, who took the Divine Myſteries from his hands to offer them unto the Lord. Yet this man ſo favoured from above fell into the like vice, that all might fear, and none be aſſured in any ſtate whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>John Climacus</hi> relates the ſtory of that young man,<note place="margin">Clim. gr. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> of whom we read in the Lives of the Fathers, who mounted unto ſo high a degree of vertue, that he commanded the wild Aſſes, and compell'd them to ſerve the Monks of the Monaſtery; whom bleſſed St. <hi>Anthony</hi> compared to a Ship laden with rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, ſailing in the middeſt of the Ocean, whoſe end was uncertain. Afterwards this ſo fervent youth fell moſt miſerably, and bewailing his ſin, ſaid unto ſome of the Monks who paſſed by, Speak unto the old man (that is St. <hi>Anthony</hi>) that he pray unto God, that he would grant me yet ten dayes of repentance. The holy man hearing this toar the hair from his head, and ſaid, <hi>A great Pillar of the Church if fallen:</hi> and five dayes after the Monk died, in ſo much as he who heretofore commanded the wild beaſts of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, became a ſcorn to the Devils, and he who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf by bread from heaven, was afterward deprived of his ſpiritual ſuſtenance.<note place="margin">Heracl. in Parad.</note> Lamentable alſo is the accident related by <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Hieron Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> who having flouriſhed many years in great vertue and fame of ſanctity,<note place="margin">Andr.

                     <p> The change of humane things ſhews clearly their vanity, and how worthy they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis inconſtancy and change of things ſerve as a teſtimony of their vanity. Witneſs thoſe who have had the largeſt experience of humane greatneſs and felicity. <hi>Gilimer</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> was of great power, wealth and valour, but overcome by <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and deprived of his Kingdome, was led in triumph through the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> When he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the place, where <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour was ſeated in a Throne of incomparable Majeſty, cloathed in his Imperial Robes, and compaſſed with the great Princes of his Empire, the Captive King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him in ſo great glory, and himſelf a Slave, abandoned of the whole world, neither wept nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, nor ſhewed the leaſt ſign of ſorrow or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Procop. li. <hi>2.</hi> de bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalorum.</note> but onely uttered that moſt true ſentence of the Wiſe-man, <hi>Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.</hi> He who knew this, no marvail though in ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51068:136"/>he had drie eyes. For if he knew that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane greatneſs was vanity, wherefore ſhould he grieve for that which was nothing? That is not worthy of grief, which deſerves not love. Things ſo mutable are thoſe below, that as they merit not our affections when we enjoy them, ſo they ought not to vex and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us when we loſe them. This apprehenſion was the cauſe of the great equality of mind, which this Prince expreſt in all his actions, who was ſo far from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any grief in the loſs of his Kingdom and fortunes, that he rather ſeemed to laugh and rejoyce; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he was overthrown in battail, and forced to flye into <hi>Numidia,</hi> where he fortified himſelf in one of the Mountains, the Enemy beſieging and ſtreightning him with want of victuals, he ſent to the Captain, who commanded in chief, to demand of him Bread, a Sponge, and a Cittern; Bread to ſuſtain his life, which was now like to periſh for want of food: a Sponge, to drie his eyes, for that having now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the conſideration of the vanity of humane things, and aſhamed at his grief for the loſs of them, he was reſolved to change his paſſions, and rather laugh than weep: for what being poſſeſt afforded no ſecurity, the ſame being loſt brought no prejudice; and to this end demanded a Cittern; for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wiped his eyes from their fruitleſs tears, he was now reſolved to change his complaints into ſongs, and his grief into content, which conſiſts not ſo much in the abundance of a great fortune, as in the ſufficiency of a moderate. And with reaſon might he take the Cittern; for if he well conſidered, he might rejoyce even in his miſhap, ſince his loſs made him underſtand that deceit of the World, which his moſt ample Kingdom never could, and freed him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from cares and troubles, but from ſins, which in the proſperity of this life have a larger field, than in an adverſe fortune. Poſſeſſed of this truth they took him priſoner, and brought him to the conquering <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius.</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:51068:136"/>The Captive King came with thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy and mirth, that the General ſeeing him laugh, whom he judged to have ſo great a cauſe of tears, thought his grief had diſtracted him, and that lie had loſt his wits; but he never had them perfecter, ſince he laught at human greatneſs, and now perceived how ridiculous a thing is that which we call felicity, and in his heart rightly eſteemed it, as it is, a vanity of vanities.</p>
                  <p>I believe the ſame judgement, which this King gave of the vanity of temporal things, would, if it had been askt, been given by the Emperour <hi>Andronicus</hi> when naked, and his head ſhaved like a Slave, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly dragged thorow the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> What was then his Imperial Diadem? what his Throne and Majeſty? what his Ornaments of gold and ſilver? All was vanity, and a vanity of vanities. Neither would this have been denied by <hi>Vitellius,</hi> when they threw dirt in his face, and haled him into the Market-place to be executed. What were then the Spectacles of the Amphitheater, and Games of the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> the Signiory of the World, but vanity of vanities, and univerſal vanity? The ſame would <hi>Craeſus</hi> have preached from the flames, the Tyrant <hi>Bajazet</hi> from his Cage, King <hi>Boliſlaus</hi> from his Kitchen, and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> from his School. If alive they would have ſaid this upon the ſight onely of the inſtability of this life, what would they now ſay upon the experience of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereinto they are entred? Let us take the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe Princes which are damned, what they now think of the Majeſty, which they enjoyed in this life; Vanity they will ſay it was, a ſmoke, a dream, a ſhadow. And without doubt thoſe Kings, which are now in heaven in poſſeſſion of thoſe eternal joyes, will ſay the ſame, That all felicity here below, is poor, ſcarce and ſhort, and vanity of vanities, and worſe, if it have been an occaſion of ſin. But it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to call witneſſes from the other life, ſince the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51068:137"/>of this is ſo evident, that he who ſhall ſet himſelf to conſider the greatneſs of this World, ſhall perceive that by how much it is more glorious, by ſo much it is more vain. What greater Majeſty than that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? Let us call to mind what happened in that. Scarce was the election of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour known before they, who choſe him, or ſome more ſubtle or powerful than they, had murthered him. An although they ſtudied nothing more than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves in the Imperial dignity, yet few there were that could effect it. Amongſt nineteen or twenty Emperours, which paſſed betwixt <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and <hi>Claudius</hi> the ſecond, not one eſcaped a violent death, beſides many other Tyrants, who took the names of Emperours; as in <hi>Galienus</hi> his time thirty uſurped that title, and murthered one another: in ſo much as he who called himſelf an Emperour, was almoſt certain to die a violent death; ſo as the greateſt felicity of the world was tyed to the greateſt miſhap. And it is to be wondered, that any (though almoſt forced) would accept the Diadem. But ſuch is the folly of men, that having before their eyes ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lamentable examples they gape after thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which hardly laſt from morning until night. Some of them had ſcarce been ſaluted Emperours, when they were cut in pieces. <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was one of thoſe who exhibited the moſt glorious triumph that ever <hi>Rome</hi> beheld, where were ſhewed An infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Captives from the three parts of the World, Many rare beaſts, as Tygers, Lions, Ounces, Elephants, Dromidaries, A mighty quantity of Arms taken from the conquered Enemies, Three moſt ſumptuous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, one of the King of <hi>Palmerins,</hi> another of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and a third of the <hi>Goths,</hi> Two who called themſelves Emperours, and the great Queen <hi>Cenobia</hi> adorned with moſt precious jewels, and rich pearls, and fettered in chains of gold. He himſelf entred in a triumphal Chariot taken from the King of <hi>Gothes,</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:51068:137"/>drawn by Stags, immediately followed by the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army richly armed, crowned with Laurel, and carrying Palms in their hands. Never Emperour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſuch a height of glory. But how long laſted it? A ſhort time after he was ſtabbed with poniards, having hardly time to take notice of his greatneſs, much leſs to enjoy it. By how many ſteps and ſtrange ways did <hi>Aelias Pertinax</hi> in his old age climb unto the Imperial Throne, and loſt it before it was known in the Empire that he commanded it? He was the Son of a Slave, and firſt a Merchant, by which he became a good accomptant; then he ſtudied Grammar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Schoolmaſter; after that a Lawyer, and having learned to defend cauſes, was made an Advocate; but not proſpering by theſe courſes he liſted himſelf a Souldier. Neither ſeemed he in that to thrive much better: for being arrived to the dignity of a Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was caſhiered with infamy. But he quitted it not ſo; for returning unto the ſame trade in proceſs of time he became a Senatour: ſhortly after Conſul, then Preſident of <hi>Syria:</hi> at laſt when he expected the Hangman to take away his life, he was ſaluted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by thoſe Souldiers, who then came freſh from the ſlaughter of <hi>Commodus.</hi> They entring his houſe by night, he told them, he was the man whom the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had ſent them to murther: but they preſented him the Scepter and Diadem, which he accepted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then 70 years of age; and after had ſcarce warmed the Imperial Seat, having onely raigned three Moneths, when he was cut in pieces in a time he leaſt ſuſpected it, being ſo beloved, eſteemed, and praiſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that every one would have ſpent a thouſand lives to have ſaved his; yet notwithſtanding a few Souldiers paſſed publickly through the middeſt of the City, and in the ſight of all ſtabbed an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſo beloved and honoured of the people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back without any ſo much as queſtioning them, when thoſe of one ſtreet (ſo few were the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51068:138"/>had been ſufficient to have killed them with ſtones. Who ſees not here the inconſtancy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humane things, as well in the life as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death of this Prince? by how many changes and windings did he climbe unto the top of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial greatneſs, and how ſodainly without any ſtop or turn at all was he tumbled headlong down? how long was his fortune in growing, and how quickly cut? ſeaventy years of a proſperous life ended in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit felicity of three Moneths, and the unhappy death of an hour. Then all is vanity of vanities, ſince that which coſts ſo much, laſts ſo little, and death in leſs than one hour overthrows the fortune of ſeaventy years.</p>

                     <p>If the felicity of this life did onely end when life ends, yet that were ſufficient to undervalue it, but it often ends before it, and ſometimes changes into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and miſhaps, ſo as with our own eyes we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten behold an end of our greateſt fortunes. Let us not therefore truſt in life, becauſe it may fail whileſt the goods of it remain, and let us as little truſt in them, becauſe they may likewiſe fail whileſt it continues. Let this inſtability of things undeceive us, and let us ſeriouſly conſider their vanity in their manner of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us; which is excellently repreſented by St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> in the Eunuch <hi>Eutropius Patrician</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hom. in Eutrop. tom. <hi>5.</hi>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51068:138"/>where the noiſe of the City, and the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acclamations of the Circus? all thoſe things are periſhed; a boyſterous wind hath blown away the leaves, and left the naked tree tottering, and almoſt pluckt up by the roots. Such was the violence of the ſtorm, that when it had ſhaken all the nerves, it threatned utterly to overthrow the ſtock. Where are now thoſe masking friends, thoſe healths and ſuppers? where that ſwarm of Paraſites, and that flood of wine poured out from morning till even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? where that exquiſite and various artifice of Cooks, thoſe Servants accuſtomed to ſay and do all that pleaſed? All theſe were no more than a Nights dream, which diſappeared with the day, Flowers which withered when the Spring was ended; a Shadow they were, and ſo they paſſed: a Smoke, and ſo they vaniſht: Bubbles in the water, and ſo they burſt: Spiders webs, and ſo were torn in ſunder. Wherefore let us ever repeat this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</hi> This ſaying ought to be written upon our Walls, Market-places, Houſes, Streets, Windows, Gates, but principally in the Conſcience of every one, ſince the deceitful employments of this life, and the enemies of truth have gained too much power and authority with many. This is it which one man ought to ſay unto another; this is it we ought to ſay at dinner, at ſupper, and in all our converſation, <hi>Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all is vanity.</hi> Did I not daily tell thee that rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were flitting and deceitful? but thou wouldeſt not endure me. Did not I tell thee, they had the condition of a fugitive Slave? but thou wouldeſt not believe me. See how experience hath taught thee, that they are not onely fugitive, but ungrateful and murthering, ſince they have caſt thee into this exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. But becauſe this Eunuch would neither be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the counſel of his Domeſticks, nor Strangers, do thou at leaſt, who art puffed up with wealth and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51068:139"/>honours, make uſe of this calamity, and turn it to thy own profit. There is nothing more infirm than humane things. By what name ſoever thou ſhalt expreſs their baſeneſs, thou ſhalt ſtill fall ſhort. Call them hay, ſmoke, a dream, flowers which wither: all is too little: they are ſo frail, that they are more nothing, than nothing it ſelf. They are not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but are ſtill in precipitation. Who was more exalted than this man? was he not famous for his wealth through the world? was he not mounted up to the height of all humane honour? Did not all fear and reverence him? But behold him now more miſerable than Slaves and Bond-men, more indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, than thoſe who beg their bread from door to door. There is no day, wherein are not ſet before his eyes Swords drawn and ſharpened to cut his throat; Precipices, Hangmen, and the Street, which lead to the Gallows. Neither doth he enjoy the memory of his pad pleaſures, nor the common light, but is at midday as in a dark night, pen'd up betwixt four walls, deprived of the uſe of his eyes. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I remember thoſe things, ſince no words are able to expreſs the fear of his mind, who every hour expects his puniſhment? to what end are my ſpeeches, when the image of his calamity appears ſo evidently before thine eyes? Not long agoe the Emperour having ſent ſome Souldiers to draw him out of the Church, whither he was fled for ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he became as pale as box, and at this inſtant hath no better colour than one who were dead. To this add that his teeth gnaſh againſt one another, his body quakes, his voice is broken with ſobbs, his tongue ſtammers; in concluſion he ſtands like one, whoſe ſoul were frozen for fear within him.</q> All this is from St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome.</hi> It is not needful to attend the end of life to ſee the impoſture of it. It is enough to ſee the alterations whileſt it laſts.</p>

                     <q>Thoſe things which fall under ſenſe, which either allure us with delight, or deject us with grief, or glitter with outward pomp and appearance, how vile are they all? how worthy of contempt? how ſordid and filthy? how ſubject to periſh, and how dead?</q> This ſaid that great Emperour and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was in its greateſt power and luſtre, and in the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the goods of the earth, being more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and having more command of them, than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> and yet he not onely ſayes they were vain, but vile, filthy, contemptible and dead. That we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this better, let us look into the ſubſtance and being, which temporal things have of themſelves, without reſpect either to the ſhortneſs of their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to the variety of their changes, for which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, although in themſelves moſt precious, yet were they moſt deſpicable; but being ſo little, ſo vile, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and for the moſt part ſo hurtful and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial unto us, although they were eternal, yet ought they to be contemned. We are not therefore onely to look upon that littleneſs and poorneſs, which they have by nature, and from themſelves, but upon the evil, which they have acquired by our abuſe; For the World, which of it ſelf were tolerable, is by us made ſuch, that it is not to be endured even by thoſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51068:140"/>who beſt love it. And to thoſe natural goods, which it affords, our unſtable appetite hath added ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial fopperies of our own inventions, that of both together we have compoſed a Monſter, no leſs hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, than that deſcribed by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.</note> And therefore he that will ſee what worldly felicity is, let him caſt his eyes upon that Beaſt, which for his unquietneſs and unconſtancy is ſaid to riſe out of the ſea. He had the head and face of a Lion, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Leopard a Beaſt various and ſpotted, and the feet of a Bear: and for his more deformity he had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads and ten horns. This the lively Image of that which paſſes in the World. For as this Monſter is compoſed of three ſavage Beaſts, of a Bear, which is carnal and luxurious, of a Leopard, whoſe skin is full of eyes, and of a Lion the proudeſt of all other Beaſts: ſo in the World there is no other thing, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> 1 <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> but the Concupiſcence of the fleſh, the Concupiſcence of the eyes, and the Pride of life, that is, Luſt and exorbitancy in pleaſures, Covetouſneſs and gaping after riches, Ambition and deſire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Of thoſe three Monſters is compoſed the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Monſters, which we call the World: the which hath alſo his ſeaven heads and ten horns, to wit, the Seaven deadly Sins, by which are impugned the ten Commandments, and the obſervation of the whole Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo conſider the myſterious diſpoſition of the parts of this Beaſt. The feet are ſaid to be of a Bear, the body of a Leopard, and the head of a Lion, becauſe all the inventions, additions, ſtratagems, and deſigns of the World are founded upon the pleaſure and delights of the appetite, which are natural: and upon this foundation our malice has builded riches, and honours which are not natural, but humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. Riches are the body of the World, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them is raiſed Pride as the head of that body. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Riches are moſt conveniently placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51068:140"/>between Pleaſure and Honours, as being neceſſary for the ſupportation of both, without which neither can be maintained. Avarice therefore forms the body of this Beaſt, that it may equally nouriſh Pleaſure and Ambition. Let us then propoſe unto our ſelves the Image of this World under the form of this Monſter and Chimaera, as well to demonſtrate the confuſion and turmoyl of it, as to ſignifie unto us, that the whole ſubſtance and being of it conſiſts meerly in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and apparence. For ſuch a Monſter compoſed of the ſeveral parts of divers Beaſts, which hath no being or foundation in reaſon, but is onely framed by the fancy, the Philoſophers call a Chimaera; and ſuch truly are the things of this World, inconſtant, confuſed and troubled, and have no ſubſtance or being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but are onely deceit and apparence. Some ſeem great, and are but little: others cozen us more, appear to be goods, and are really evils. To underſtand this better and know the vanity of the World, we are to ſuppoſe that humane malice hath corrupted and poiſoned it by inventing new guſts and pleaſures: unto which we have added by our imagination what they wanted of being and reality: and by diverting things from thoſe proper ends, for which they were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have made them all vain, and the World a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of many heads; for the head of things is, as <hi>Philo</hi> calls it, the end, and the things of the World having left their utmoſt and true end, which is one God, and diſordered themſelves by the many ends of particular vices, have made that Beaſt, which is ſaid not to have one but many heads, which makes it ſo monſtrous and deformed. Men follow not in the uſe of things their proper end, which is to pleaſe and ſerve God, but aim at the ſerving of their paſſions, and ſatisfie their appetites: which as they are divers, ſo they have divers ends and reſpects; from whence reſults the monſtroſity of ſo many heads, and faces. From the multitude then of ends follows this deformity, which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51068:141"/>includes and is alwayes accompanied with vanity. For the world following this vanity of adulterate ends, contrary to reaſon and nature, leaves the true and lawful end, which is the ſervice of God; and that which leaves its proper end becomes uſeleſs and vain. If you ſhould blind the eyes of ſome excellent Markſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his art and skill were loſt, and his Bow would become unprofitable, becauſe he remained deprived of that, by which he was to attain his end. So all things being created to this end, that man by them might ſerve God, this end wanting, they became vain and uſeleſs. By this example may be clearly ſeen how vain is the World, ſince it doth not direct thoſe things it enjoyes for the ſervice of the univerſal Creatour, but for other vain and imaginary ends, by which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes wholly it ſelf a vanity? The multitude of Gold, Silver, Plate, Jewels, precious Furniture, and other Ornaments which we glory in, are they perhaps for the ſervice of God? Let St. <hi>Alexius</hi> tell us, whether he choſe them as means to that end; and if they be not for the ſervice of the Lord of all, what are they all but vanity? Abundance of Delights, Maſques, Dances, Feaſts, Entertainments, are they perhaps to pleaſe God? Let St. <hi>Bruno</hi> tell us; and if they be not for that purpoſe, what are they all but vanity? Majeſty, oſtentation of Titles and Honours, are they perhaps for the ſervice of God? Let St. <hi>Joſaphat</hi> tell us; who fled from his Temporal Kingdom, that he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apply himſelf unto the ſervice of the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Vain is all the greatneſs of the Earth, if that of Heaven be not gained by it. The moſt precious thing failing, which is the right end, all beſides becomes vain, frivolous, and of no eſteem.</p>

                     <p>This deviation and wandering of worldly things from their proper and due end is ſufficient to declare
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51068:141"/>their vanity and diſorder. But there is yet another er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in them, which makes them appear much more vain, which is, that they not onely goe aſtray from their firſt and great end, which is the ſervice of God, but alſo fail, and hold no proportion with that ſecond end, which humane vices propoſe unto them here. That which our appetite pretends in Riches, Pomp and Honours, which it hath invented, is the felicity of this life: and to that they are ſo little proper, as they have rather diſpoſed things for our miſery and torment; and therefore vain are all our fancies and inventions. To maintain and uphold our honour, what Lawes, Rights, and irregular Cuſtoms hath the World invented to the great danger of our lives, and the hinderance of our pleaſures? It hath made honour ſo brittle, that with one word whoſoever liſt may take it from us, which is the occaſion, that many live diſhonoured; and if they will recover it, it muſt coſt their lives, fortunes, or quiet. What greater madneſs than that the thing, which they have made of the greateſt eſteem in the World, ſhould be ſubject to ſuch an inconvenience; and of ſo curſed a condition, that it is very eaſie to loſe, and moſt difficult to regain: that any one may bereave us of it, and he which hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from us, cannot reſtore it: that it is in another mans hand to deſtroy it, and not in our own to repair it? What law in the World more unjuſt, that if an infamous perſon give thee the lye, thou remaineſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, although he lied, that gave it: and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he by one word hath taken from thee, thou canſt not recover by another? What greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than to fight for honour, and maintain truth by quarrelling, as if he were the moſt honourable perſon and ſpake the trueſt, which were the ſtrongeſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being ſo prejudicial to the moſt vertuous? for it commonly happens that thoſe who have the cleareſt, wits, the nobleſt ſouls, and the moſt conſtant and ſound judgements, have the weakeſt bodies. Finally in this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51068:142"/>matter of honour men have invented ſuch lawes, ſuch punctilioes, ſuch impertinent formalities, that if they were all truely and really mad, they could not have done more abſurdly. For what is madneſs, but to doe things without proportion, order, or reaſon? which ſince the World does, we muſt conclude it vain, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and fooliſh.</p>
                     <p>Coming then to Riches, which were invented for the eaſe and commodity of life, humane malice hath made them ſuch, as they ſerve for our greater trouble and vexation. For he that is rich, will not onely be rich himſelf, but muſt have all he hath ſo too. He is not content with having a good Garment, unleſs his walls be with curious Pictures, rich Tapeſtries, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cabinets, and other rarities better clad than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which ſerve not for warmth or uſe, but onely for ſhew and appearance. From whence it happens that he, who hath moſt wealth, hath moſt want, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he not only needs for himſelf, but for all which he poſſeſſeth: ſo that he, who hath a great houſe, hath the ſame neceſſities that his houſe, which are many: for a great houſe requires much furniture, and a large Family, and ſo charges the Maſter with multitudes of Servants, great quantities of Plate, Hangings and other Ornaments ſuperfluous to uſe and humane commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in ſo much as none are more poor than the rich: becauſe they want not onely for themſelves, but for all that is theirs. At leaſt riches want not this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, that although they were invented for humane uſe and eaſe, yet he that hath them in the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance hath the greateſt cares, troubles, envies, dangers, and ever the greateſt loſſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſame diſorder and abuſe happens in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars, which at firſt were invented for a comfort, and remedy of our wants, but are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a burthen and trouble unto us. Our Garments, which were for neceſſity, are now worn for ornament, and uſing them for other ends than they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51068:142"/>they become our vexations. A girdle or a ſhooe too much ſtreightned afflicts the body and hinders us in divers actions: bravery, gold-chains, and other needleſs ornaments burthen us.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. l. <hi>1.</hi> de Virgin.</note> Wherefore St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith, <q>A weighty Chain of gold about the neck, or ſtumbling Chapines upon the feet, ſerve as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment unto women, as if they were ſome great offenders; for in reſpect of the pain and weight, with which they grieve thoſe who wear them, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, whether they be of gold or iron? both equally oppreſs their necks, and hinder their going. The price and value of the gold eaſes nothing: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds to their trouble in reſpect of the fear they live in, leſt they ſhould looſe them, or that ſome ſhould againſt their wills free them of their pain and trouble. According to this it little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports whether the pain be inflicted by our own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, (as the women in this caſe paſs it againſt themſelves) or by the award of others, as againſt offenders.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51068:143"/>and enlarged their lives for many years. But now of late, ſince we have forſaken our Country food, and given our ſelves to the curious ſeeding of other Nations, ſtrange diſeaſes have entred with ſtrange diſhes.</q> And in his ninth Book he ſaith, that they knew not plagues, nor ſharp and violent Fevers ſo long as they preſerved their ancient diet.</p>
                     <p>This ſeparation and wandring of worldly things from their principal and chief end, which is God, cauſes ſuch a diſtance betwixt them and reaſon, that therefore they become a Monſter; and ſo St. <hi>John</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly paints the World in the figure of this Monſter with ſeaven heads of a beaſt, and none of a man. For if that man were monſtrous, which had no humane head, but ſeaven of brutiſh creatures, no leſs Monſter is the World, which wants the natural end, and head, which is God, whom it ought to ſeek according to reaſon, and not purſue thoſe falſe and adulterate ends which are contrary to it. The World wants the head of a man, becauſe it doth not order it ſelf according to the end of reaſon; and it retains the heads of beaſts, becauſe it is guided by paſſion, appetite, and the like, which are the ends of beaſts. If we ſhall then behold the great vanity of things together with the multitude of vices, wherein men have involved them, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make them worſe, to whom can this beaſt irritated with ſo many ſharp goads, as are our ſins, be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What injuſtice is not committed? what flattery not inſinuated? what cozenage not attempted? And what revenge not executed? Avarice diſquiets all, Luxury corrupts it, and Ambition treads it under foot.</p>
                     <p>From what is ſaid it follows, that the things of this World, repreſented unto us by St. <hi>John</hi> under the figure of thoſe three fierce and cruel beaſts, are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our diſorderly manner of uſing them much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and hurtful both to our ſouls and bodies.

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEtting aſide how vain the things of this World are, let us particularly conſider how little they are, and we ſhall perceive that though their vanity, which ſwells and blows them up, ſeems to extend them, yet they are in themſelves poor, ſhort and little, eſpecially
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51068:144"/>if we compare them with things eternal. Beginning therefore with that temporal good, which ſeems to have the greateſt bulk; and makes the greateſt noiſe, to wit Honour, Fame and Renown, we ſhall ſee how narrow it is. Men deſire that their fame ſhould ring through the whole World, and that all ſhould know their names; and if they did, what are all in reſpect of thoſe in the other World, ſince the whole Earth in reſpect of the Heavens is but a point? But who is he that can be known of all who live? Millions of men, there are in the World, who know not whether there be an Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> or a King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Let no man then afflict himſelf for this vain honour; for even in his own Country all ſhall not know him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand years are paſt, and no man knew thee, and of thoſe, who ſhall be born hereafter, few ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee: and although thou remaineſt in the memory of thoſe, yet they alſo in the end muſt die, and with them thine and their own memory muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and thou ſhalt, as before thou wert, continue a whole eternity without being known or celebrated by any. And even now, whileſt thou liveſt, there are not many who know thee, and of thoſe moſt of them ſo bad, that thou oughteſt to be aſhamed, that ſuch mouthes ſhould praiſe thee, who ſpeak ill even of one another. Wherefore then doeſt thou torment thy ſelf for a thing ſo ſhort, ſo vile, and ſo vain? All theſe things are ſo certain, that even the Gentils acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them.

                     </note> ſince he was Lord of it, the Emperour <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus,</hi> who ſpeaks in this manner. <q>Perhaps thou art ſollicitous of honour. Behold how quickly oblivion blots out all things. Behold a Chaos of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity both before and after. How vain is the noiſe of fame? how great inconſtancie, and uncertainty of humane judgements and opinions? in how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a compaſs are all things incloſed? The World
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51068:144"/>is but a point: and of it how ſmall a corner is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and who and how many are thoſe in it who are to praiſe thee? And a little after he adds: He who deſires fame and honour after death, thinks not that he, who is to remember him, ſhall ſhortly die alſo, and in the ſame manner he who is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed after him, untill that all memory, which is to be propagated by mortal men, be blotted out. But ſuppoſe that thoſe, who are to remember thee, were immortal, what could it import thee being dead? nay even alive what could it profit thee to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? all that is fair, is fair of it ſelf, and is perfected within it ſelf, and to be praiſed is no part of the beauty. He therefore who is celebrated is for that reaſon neither better nor worſe.</q> Theſe Antidotes are drawn by the Pagan Prince againſt the poiſon of ambition. Why therefore ſhould we Chriſtians eſteem any honour but that of God?</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of the vanity of thoſe titles, which many have aſſumed againſt all reaſon and juſtice, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make themſelves known in the World? Let us judge how it will fare with us of <hi>Europe</hi> by thoſe, who have taken titles upon them in <hi>Aſia.</hi> For if the fame of thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> arrive not to the knowledge of us in <hi>Europe,</hi> no more ſhall ours in <hi>Europe</hi> to theirs in <hi>Aſia.</hi> The name of <hi>Echebar</hi> was thought by his Subjects to be eternal, and that all the World did not only know,<note place="margin">Jarricus in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.

But ask here in <hi>Europe,</hi> who he was, and no man hath heard of him; and demand now of the moſt learned, and few ſhall reſolve you, unleſs perchance he find here in my writing, that he raigned in <hi>Mogor.</hi> How few have heard of the name of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catapadino Ragiu?</hi> he imagined that there was no man in the World, who knew him not. The ſame thought had his Servants, and called him, <hi>The Lord of Kings, and ſupreme Emperour.</hi> The titles which he arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to himſelf, and put in his Edicts were theſe: <hi>The Spouſe of good fortune, King of great Provinces,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51068:145"/>King of the greateſt Kings, and God of Kings, Lord of all the Horſemen, Maſter of thoſe who cannot ſpeak, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of three Emperours, Conquerour of all he ſees, and Preſerver of all he conquers, Formidable unto the eight Regions of the World, Lord of the Provinces which he overcomes, Deſtroyer of the Mahometan Armies, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the riches of</hi> Zeilan, <hi>He who cut off the head of the invincible</hi> Viravalano, <hi>Lord of the Eaſt, South, North, and Weſt, and of the Sea, Hunter of Elephants, He that lives and glories in his military valour. Theſe titles of honour are enjoyed by the moſt excellent in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like forces</hi> Vencatapadino Ragiu, <hi>which rules and governs this World.</hi> How many can tell me, before I declare it here, that he was the King of <hi>Narſinga?</hi> If then theſe warlike and potent Princes are not known in <hi>Europe,</hi> No more ſhall <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift, and the Grand Captain, and many other Excellent men in arms and litterature, which have flouriſhed in theſe parts, be known in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we ſhall reflect upon the truth of thoſe titles, which many arrogate unto themſelves, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them all to be vain. How many are called High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Excellence, who are of a baſe and abject ſpirit, and continue in mortal ſin, which is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and loweſt thing in the World? How many are called <hi>Screniſſimi,</hi> who have their underſtanding darkened, and their will perverted? Others call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt Magnificent, with as much reaſon as <hi>Nero</hi> might be called moſt Clement. This vanity hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far, that men have not feared to uſurp thoſe titles, which only belong to God, and have thereupon raiſed, great warres, and ſlain innumerable people. Wherefore St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, that the Beaſt which roſe out of the Sea, had upon his head names of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and afterwards that the purple Beaſt was full of names of Blaſphemy in regard of the blood that hath been ſpilt in the World for thoſe vain titles, and ſome of them contrary unto the eſſence of God, as the calling
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51068:145"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> Eternal, and deifying her Emperours, which was no better than blaſphemy. The things wherein we have placed honour makes it moſt ridiculous. Some think they ſhould be valued and eſteemed becauſe they are ſtrong: not remembring that a Bear, a Bull, or a Sumpter-mule is ſtronger than they. Some becauſe they are richly clad become mighty proud and puft up, not being aſhamed to be more eſteemed for the work of a Mechanick Taylor, than for their vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Others think to be honoured for their diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, bragging of their vices, murthers, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Others boaſt of the nobility of their blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking upon vertue, and ſo make that a vice, which was to oblige them to noble actions, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was to be their honour into infamy, valuing themſelves more for being noble, than being Chriſtians. A man is no greater than what he is in the eyes of God; and the eſtimation which God hath of us is not for being born in a Palace, but for being reborn in the water of Baptiſm. What compariſon is there betwixt being born of noble linage, and being born from the ſide of Chriſt Jeſus? The penitent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Donna Sancha Carillo</hi> ſo often as ſhe aſſiſted at Baptiſms beheld Chriſt upon the Croſs,<note place="margin">Ro. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus vita lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> with his ſide open, and the Child iſſuing forth: giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the new birth we receive from the blood of Chriſt in our Chriſtianity, for which God eſteems men more than for being born of ſinful blood. This birth is of diſhonour, that of honour; this of ſin, that of holineſs; this of the fleſh which kills, that of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which quickneth; by this we are the ſons of men, by that of God; by the birth of the fleſh we are heirs of our fathers fortunes, but much more of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for we are born ſinners; by the birth of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm we are the heirs of heaven, and for the preſent we receive grace, and for the future glory. What an errour is it then to value our ſelves more for our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane birth, by which we are made ſinners, than for
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51068:146"/>our divine birth, by which we are made juſt? How fooliſh were he, who being the Son of a King and a Bond-woman ſhould eſteem himſelf more for being the Son of a Slave than of a Monarch? More fool is he who values more the nobility of his blood in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gentleman, than the nobility of his ſoul in being a Chriſtian. Finally all honours of the earth are but ſuch, as <hi>Matathias</hi> told his Sons, <hi>dung and corruption.</hi> St. <hi>Anſelme</hi> compares thoſe who ſeek after honours, to boyes who hunt after butter-flies: <hi>Iſaias</hi> unto ſpiders, which diſimbowel themſelves in framing a web, which is broken by the flies. Yet for all this poorneſs and baſeneſs of honours many ſouls have periſhed by them. If <hi>David</hi> curſed the mountains of <hi>Gelboe</hi> becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> died upon them, with much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may we curſe the high mountains of honour, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſo many Souls have been ſeen to periſh?</p>

What are Precious ſtones, but ſhining pibles, ſome red, ſome green, &amp;c? Silk, but the ſlaverings of worms? the fineſt Hollands and pureſt Linnens, but threads of certain plants? Other webbs of eſteem are made of hair of beaſts: whereof if we ſhould meet one in our meat, would make us loath it: and many in their cloaths are proud of them. Curious Furres what are they, but the skins of contemptible

Amber, but the uncleanneſs of a Whale, or ſomething which the Sea purges from it as not worthy to be preſerved? Musk, but the putrified and congealed blood of a poor Beaſt? What are Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Palaces, Cities, Provinces and ſpacious Kingdoms?

How many kinds of curious Stuffs have been woven to pleaſe us in our Garments? what diverſitie of eaſie Beds and Couches have been found out? what cloſe Chairs, Litters, and Coaches have with exceſſive coſt and charges been invented? and the invention of them is no ſooner known, but we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it with that pride and haſte, that they eſteem themſelves unhappy, who enjoy them laſt, although their uſe be no wayes neceſſary.<note place="margin">Fra.

And now what more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? The invention, becauſe eaſie, was ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that in few years people of very ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition began to uſe them: in ſo much as it was thought
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51068:148"/>fit within a very ſhort time after to prohibit them; which is more to be admired in reſpect of the ſimple and homely way which a little before was uſed by the moſt eminent perſons. They write of the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> who for wealth and nobility is one of the greateſt in <hi>Spain,</hi> that when he and the Dutcheſs went to viſit our Ladies <hi>de Regla,</hi> a Church of great devotion in <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> they went in a Cart drawn with Oxen, the which was in the year 1540. Shortly after within five or ſix years came the Coach into <hi>Spain</hi> whereof we have ſpoken, and within nine or ten years there was ſuch a multitude of them, that by a publick Edict in the year 1577 all Coaches with two horſes were forbidden, becauſe many of inferiour condition uſed them both to the deſtruction of many ſerviceable horſes, and to the prejudice of their own wealth and modeſty. With ſuch haſte doth our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appetite run after what it conceives commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, piecing out with art that which ſeemed ſhort in nature. The ſame happened, as <hi>Dio Caſſius</hi> reports, with Litters, which were brought into <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> but quickly, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, it was neceſſary for the ſame <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to forbid them.</p>
                     <p>The ſame hath and doth paſs in coſtly Apparel, which is ſo equal a diſorder, that <hi>Tully</hi> doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more indecent for the nature of man, The uſe of Coaches, or the curioſity of Garments, and calls them both impudent and ſhameleſs; And truely, as they are uſed by many, they are no leſs. The ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers counted their Arms as the members of their bodies, becauſe they were no leſs troubled with the loſs of the one than the other. The ſame account many make of their neat and curious garments: and are no leſs ſenſible if their cloathes chance to be diſordered, than if they had a member broken or out of joynt. <hi>Macrobius</hi> writes of <hi>Quintus Hortenſius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Senatour, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51068:148"/>he was ſo curious in ordering his Garments by a large Looking-glaſs made on purpoſe, and diſpoſing the plates of his Gown, which he gathered after into a quaint knot after the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, that being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and going into the <hi>Forum</hi> in all this nice formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, accompanied with his Collegue, it happened that in a great preſs and croud of people his fellow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul chanced to diſorder a little the plates of his Gown: which he took ſo hainouſly, that he commenced an action of offence againſt him, which the <hi>Romans</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>de Injuria,</hi> as if he had broken his arm or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member. What ſhall I ſay of Ornaments ſo coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo fooliſh, that even the World it ſelf ſeems to condemn them, in regard that being now glutted with the Garnitures of ſilk and gold, it falls to make Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries of ſtraw: as if it had already learnt and underſtood, that for the uſe of Garments it is one and the ſame thing to adorn them with ſtraw, as with gold and ſilver; and for this reaſon Laces and Points made of ſtraw are made uſe of in lieu of gold and ſilver?</p>
                     <p>But after the divers Inventions of Apparel, who can reckon the ſeveral wayes invented to pleaſe our ſenſes? The mixture of ſeveral Meats for the taſte? the confection of Sweet-paſts and Perſumes for the ſmell? the melodious Muſick of diver; Inſtruments for the hearing? the Games, Pictures, and Shows for the ſight, which Entertainments have been exhibited even with the ſpilling of humane blood? Witneſs the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Bulls of <hi>Spain.</hi> All this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of pleaſures, which the appetite hath invented, are an evident ſigne of the poverty and inſufficiency of nature, ſince all this multitude of artificial contents doth not ſatisfie it, nor in any ſort equal our natural griefs.</p>
                     <p>For ſo ſleight a matter is loſt a thing ſo great, as is Eternity. For theſe we aboliſh the Law of God from our hearts, and diſpleaſe our Redeemer, who

Not long after he found means to ſpeak unto him, and know his holy exerciſes. At firſt he onely acquainted him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vertues, That he gave large Alms, That he wore hair-cloth, That he faſted often, That he obſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal chaſtity, and That he cauſed juſtice to be exactly obſerved. Theſe vertues ſeemed well unto the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, eſpecially in ſuch a perſon: but yet judged all this to be ſhort of himſelf, who had done thoſe things with greater perfection; For he had renounced all, and given all he poſſeſſed for Chriſt, which was more than to give almes; he never knew woman in his life, which was more than to obſerve conjugal chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he never did injury or injuſtice unto any, which was more than to cauſe it to be kept to others; his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51068:149"/>hair-cloth and faſts from all ſorts of dainties were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, which was more than to abſtain ſome dayes from fleſh. Wherefore altogether unſatisfied he further importuned the Emperour, beſeeching him to conceal nothing from him; That it was the Divine will that he ſhould acquaint him with what he did, and that therefore he was ſent unto him from God. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour thus urged ſaid unto him, Know then that when I aſſiſt at the horſe-courſes, and ſpectacles in the Circus, where my preſence is required, I ſo withdraw my minde from thoſe vanities, that though my eyes be open I ſee them not. The Hermit remained aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht at ſo particular a mortification in ſo great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and perceived that Scepters and Purple could not hinder a devout Prince from mortification of his affections, and meriting much with God Almighty. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> further added; Know alſo that I ſuſtain my ſelf by my labour; for I tranſcribe certain parchments into a fair hand, which being ſold, the price payes for my food. With this example of poverty amongſt ſo much riches, and temperance in the middeſt of ſo great dainties, the Hermit was wholly amazed, and learned that abſtinence from eaſe and pleaſures of this life, was that which made this religious Prince ſo gracious and acceptable unto our Lord. Finally ſo perverſe are the delights of the World, that, though lawful, yet they hinder much our ſpiritual proficiency, and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, are the total ruine of our Souls.</p>

                        <q>Look not upon the Crown, ſaith he, but upon that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of cares which accompany it. Fix not thy eyes upon the purple, but upon the mind of the King more ſad and dark than the purple it ſelf. The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem doth not more encompaſs his head, than cares and ſuſpicions his ſoul. Look not at the Squadions of his Guard, but at the Armies of moleſtations which attend him; for nothing can be ſo full of cares as the Palaces of Kings. Every day they expect not one death, but many; nor can it be ſaid how often in the night their hearts tremble with ſome ſodain fright, and their ſouls almoſt ſeem to forſake their bodies, and this in the time of peace. But when a warre is kindled, what life ſo miſerable as theirs? how many dangers happen unto them, even from their Friends and Subjects? The floor of the Royal Palace is drowned in the blood of their Kindred. If I ſhall mention thoſe which have happened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore and now of late, thou wilt eaſily know them. This ſuſpecting his Wife tied her naked in the mountains, and left her to be devoured by wild beaſts, after ſhe had been a Mother of divers Kings. What a life had that man; it being impoſſible he ſhould execute ſuch a revenge, unleſs his ſick heart had been eaten and conſumed with jealouſie? This put to death his onely Son. This killed himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by the Tyrant. This murthered his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew after he had made him his companion in the Empire. This his Brother, who died by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and his innocent Son ended his life onely for what he might have been. Of thoſe Princes which followed, one of them was with his Slaves and Chariots miſerably burnt alive; and it is not poſſible for words to expreſs the calamities which he was forced to endure. And he, which now raigns, hath he not ſince he was crowned ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51068:150"/>many troubles, dangers, griefs and treaſons? but in Heaven it is not ſo.</q> After this manner St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> paints forth the greateſt fortune of the World, the Imperial Majeſty, which muſt needs be little, ſince it is ſo unhappy, that it ſuffers not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thoſe frail goods of the earth in ſecurity, but makes the poſſeſſors oftentimes periſh before them. But it is far otherwiſe in Heaven, the Palace and Houſe of God; where the juſt without mixture or counterpoiſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery are to enjoy thoſe goods eternal, as we ſhall ſee in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, let us learn from hence not to admire the greatneſs of this World, nor to deſire the benefit of it; Which leſſon was well taught by St. <hi>Spiridion</hi> unto his Diſciple, who accompanying him one time unto the Court of the Emperour, ſuffered himſelf to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with thoſe things which he beheld. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and luſtre of the Court, The rich Garments, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Pearls, and precious Stones dazled the eyes of the raw and unexperienced youth: but above all the ſight of the Emperour, ſeated in his Imperial Throne with ſo much ſplendour and greatneſs, almoſt drew him beſides himſelf. St. <hi>Spiridion</hi> willing one day to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his errour, asked him, (as if he had not known it,) Which of thoſe were the Emperour. His Diſciple not reaching his intention, pointing with his finger, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply told him, That was he. And wherefore replyed the Saint, is this man more to be eſteemed than the reſt? is it perhaps becauſe he is more vertuous? or is it becauſe he is adorned with more exterior luſtre and bravery? is not he likewiſe to die as well as the moſt poor and unknown beggar? is he not to be buried? is he not as well as the reſt of men to appear before the juſt Judge? Wherefore then doeſt thou value thoſe things which are to paſs, as if they were to laſt for ever? Wherefore doeſt thou admire that which hath no conſiſtence? It were fitter for thee to place thy eyes and heart upon things eternal
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51068:151"/>and incorruptible, and to be enamoured of thoſe, which are not ſubject to change and death.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Diſciple of <hi>Spiridion,</hi> being now Biſhop, travelled one time with his Maſter, who was then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Archbiſhop of <hi>Trimitunte;</hi> and as they came to a certain place, where the fields were very fertile and pleaſant, the Diſciple being much taken with them, began to caſt within himſelf, how he might compaſs an Inheritance in that good Country, and lay it to his Church. The Saint, who underſtood his thoughts, gave him this ſweet and gentle reprehenſion. To what purpoſe, dear Brother, doeſt thou trouble thy thoughts with things ſo vain and of ſo little ſubſtance? Wherefore doeſt thou deſire Land and Vineyards to labour and cultivate? doeſt thou not know that theſe things are onely of an outward appearance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are nothing, or at leaſt are worth nothing? We have an Inheritance in Heaven, which none can take from us; There we have a houſe not made by the hands of men. Look after thoſe goods, and begin now even before the time by the vertue of hope to enjoy them. Thoſe goods are of that condition, that if you once poſſeſs them, and make your ſelf Lord of them, you ſhall be then their eternal heir, and your Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall never paſs to others. Let one place himſelf in the point of death, and let him from thence, on the one part behold the littleneſs of all things temporal, which are now paſt, and on the other the greatneſs of Eternity, whereinto he enters, which ſhall never paſs, and he ſhall eaſily diſcover, how all the greatneſs, and commodities of this life are for their littleneſs and ſhort endurance rather worthy of laughter than admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

For this reaſon ſome Philoſophers repenting that they lived, would blaſpheme Nature, railing at it with a thouſand complaints and injuries, becauſe to the beſt of living things it had given ſo bad and wretched a life: not reaching ſo high as to know that this was an effect of the fault of man, and not a fault of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Divine Providence. <hi>Pliny</hi> would ſay, That Nature was but a Stepmother to mankind; and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> being demanded, what was the greateſt happineſs man was capable of, ſaid, <hi>Not to be born, or die quickly.</hi> The great Philoſopher and Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> conſidering humane miſery ſpake in this diſcreet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.<note place="margin">Aurel.

                     <q>The warre of this life is dangerous, and the end and iſſue of it ſo terrible and dreadful, that I am certain, that if any of the ancient ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and recount unto us faithfully, and give us a view of his life paſt from the time he came out of his Mothers womb unto his laſt gaſp, the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating at large the pains and griefs it hath ſuffered, and the heart the alarms it hath received from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that all men would be amazed at a body, that had endured ſo much, and at a heart, that had gained ſo great a victory, and diſſembled it.

Neither ſpeak I onely of the infirmities, but of their remedies. For even griefs known and common are cured by cauterizing with fire, by ſawing off a member, by tripanizing the ſcull, or drawing bones from it. Some have been cured with the opening the belly, and drawing forth the guts. Others by reaſon of the great malice of the diſeaſe are cured with ſo ſtrange diets, that the ſick perſons (as <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> writes) have for very thirſt drunk their Urine, and eaten their Plaſters for raging hunger. Others are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51068:152"/>to eat Snakes, Mice, Worms, and other loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Vermin. But above all the cure of <hi>Palaeologus</hi> the Second, Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was moſt cruel and extravagant: whoſe infirmity after a years continuance found no other remedy but to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vext and diſpleaſed, his Wife and Servants, who moſt deſired his health, having no wayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, but by diſobedience, ſtill croſſing and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in what he moſt deſired; a harſh cure for a Prince. If remedies be ſo great evils, what are the infirmities? The ſickneſs of <hi>Angelus Politianus</hi> was ſo vehement, that he knockt his head againſt the walls: That of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> ſo ſtrange, that he ſlept not, nor clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his eyes in three whole years: That of <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſo peſtilential, that his loathſome ſmel infected his whole Army, and his body (as hath been ſaid) flowed with lice and vermin. Conſider here the end of Majeſty, when the greateſt power of the Earth cannot defend it ſelf againſt ſo noiſome and ſo contemptible an enemy. In the ſame manner <hi>Feretrina,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Barcaeans,</hi> all the fleſh of her body turned into maggots and grubbs, that ſwarming every where at laſt conſumed her. Some have had ſerpents bred in their arms and thighs, which have devoured their fleſh even whileſt they lived.

In the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> there was ſo mortal a Peſtilence in <hi>Romania,</hi> that in a few dayes many thouſands died, and the greater part of thoſe, who were ſtruck, flung themſelves into the River to aſſwage that exceſſive heat, which like a fire burnt their entrails. <hi>Thucidides</hi> a Greek Author writes, that in his time there was ſuch a corruption of the air, that an infinite of people died, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy could be found to mitigate that diſaſter; and which was moſt ſtrange, if any by good hap recovered, they remained without memory at all of what was paſt: in ſo much as the Fathers forgot their Sons, and Husbands their Wives. <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor worthy of credit, ſpeaks of a Plague in his time ſo great in <hi>Italy,</hi> that it was eaſier to number the quick than the dead.

                     <p>The calamities of the times nearer ours have been no leſs. For as our ſins decreaſe not, ſo the juſtice of God in puniſhing us ſlakes not.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51068:153"/>there died ſo many thouſands of people, that many Townes and Provinces remained deſert. Such was the putrifaction of the air, that it left almoſt nothing alive; and thoſe few, that remained, in ſigne of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to avert the wrath of God, went ſigned with red Croſſes. They write that it was ſo violent in England, that not onely men died, but birds left their neſts, their eggs, and young ones, the wilde beaſts quitted their Dennes, and ſnakes and moles were ſeen to goe in companies and troopes, not being able to endure the poyſon encloſed in the bowells of the earth; and many creatures were found in heapes dead under trees, their bodies broken out into blanes and botches. The yeare 1546. the laſt of <hi>May</hi> began in <hi>Stix</hi> (a City of <hi>Provence</hi>) a moſt mortal peſtilence, which laſted nine moneths; in which died an infinite number of people of all ages; in ſo much as the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards were ſo full of dead bodies, as there was no room left to bury others. The greateſt part of thoſe, who were infected, the ſecond day became frantick and flung themſelves out of windowes, or into wells; others fell into a flux of blood at the noſe, which if they ſtanched they inſtantly died. Married women became abortive, or at four moneths end they, and what they went with died, whom they found covered over with ſpots ſomething blewiſh on one ſide, which ſeemed like blood ſprinkled over their body. The evil was ſo great, that Fathers forſook their Children, and Women their Husbands; Riches did not preſerve them from dying of hunger, a pot of water being not ſometimes to be had for money. If they found by chance what to eat, the fury of the ſickneſs was ſuch, as they often died with the morſel in their mouths. The contagion became ſo great, that many took it by being onely looked upon; and the ayr of the City was ſo corrupted by the grievous heat of this peſtilential evil, that whereſoever the ſteam of it came, it raiſed great bliſters, mortal ſores and carbuncles. O how monſtrous and horrible a thing it
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51068:154"/>is, to hear the relation of the Phyſician, who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the cure and government of the ſick? This infirmity, ſaith he, was ſo ſharp and perverſe, that neither Bleeding, Purging, Treacles, nor other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials could ſtay it; it kill'd and bore down all before it, in ſo much as the onely remedy, which the infected perſons hoped for, was death, of which being certain, ſo ſoon as they found themſelves ill, they began to make their Winding-ſheets; and there were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand who wore them whileſt they yet lived, knowing certainly that the remedy and end of their evil was to die: and in this manner ſtood expecting the departure of the ſoul, and the fearful ſeparation of the two ſo dear friends and companions: which he affirms to have ſeen in many perſons; eſpecially in one woman, who calling him at her window to appoint ſomething for her infirmity, he ſaw ſewing her Winding-ſheet; and not long after thoſe who were appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre the dead, entring the houſe found her ſtretched out upon the floor, her Winding-ſheet not yet finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To all this is humane life ſubject. Let thoſe therefore who are in health and jollity fear what may befall them.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FAmine is no leſs a miſery of mans life than Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which not onely particular perſons, but whole Provinces have often ſuffered. Such was that which afflicted the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>Alaricus</hi> that arch-Enemy of Mankind after the deſtruction of all <hi>Italy</hi> beſieged <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> came to that poverty, famine, and want of all things, that having nothing left of that which men commonly uſe to eat, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feed on Horſes, Dogs, Cats, Rats, Dormice, and other vermin, where they could lay hold on them;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51068:154"/>and when thoſe failed, they eat one another. A hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible condition of humane nature, that when God ſuffers us to fall into thoſe ſtraights, our neceſſity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us to feed upon our own kind. Nay, Fathers ſpare not their Sons, nor Women thoſe, whom they have brought forth. The ſame happened in the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> recounts in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. At the Siege of <hi>Numantia,</hi> when <hi>Scipio</hi> had cut off all proviſions from entring the Town, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants fell into that mortal and dog-like famine, that every day they ſallied forth to catch <hi>Romans,</hi> as if they had hunted after wilde beaſts. Thoſe whom they took they fed upon their fleſh, and drunk their blood, as if they had drunk fountain water or fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kid. They pardoned none; but ſuch as fell into their hands were cut in quarters, and ſold by pieces publickly in the Butchery; in ſo much as the fleſh of a dead <hi>Roman</hi> was of greater value than the ranſome of a live one. In the fourth book of <hi>Kings</hi> there is mention made of a Famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the time of <hi>Elizeus</hi> the Prophet, which much exceeds this. The want of food was ſo great, that the head of an Aſs was ſold for 80 pieces of ſilver, and the fourth part of a ſmall meaſure of Pigeons dung for 5 pieces. The moſt lamentable and inhumane was, that having ſpent all their proviſion, Women eat their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and one Woman complained to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that her neighbour had broken an Agreement made betwixt them, which was, That they ſhould firſt eat her Child, and, that done, the others. I, ſayes ſhe, have complied with my obligation, and we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready eaten mine, and now ſhe hath hid hers, and denies me my part. Which the King hearing rent his garments, and was ſtruck with unſpeakable ſorrow. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the ſeaventh Book of the Wars of the <hi>Jews</hi> relates a ſtory much like unto this,<note place="margin">Joſeph. l. <hi>7.</hi> de bel. Jud. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> but executed with more fury, and after a more ſtrange manner. There was, ſaith he, in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when it was beſieged, a Lady
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51068:155"/>rich and noble, who had hid in a houſe of the City the moſt part of her wealth, and of the reſt lived ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with great moderation. But ſhe was not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo long; for the Souldiers of the Garriſon diſcovering her ſtock in a ſhort time bereaved her both of what ſhe had within doors and without; and if ſhe chanced at any time to be relieved by friends, or beg ſome little thing to aſſwage her hunger, they would take it from her, and tear the morſel out of her mouth. Seeing her ſelf therefore deſtitute of all hope or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and certain to die of hunger, and no poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy left for her neceſſities, ſhe began to arm her ſelf againſt the laws of Nature, and beholding the Infant which hung at her breaſt, ſhe cried out in this manner; O unhappy Son of a more unhappy Mother! how ſhall I now diſpoſe of thee? where ſhall I preſerve thee? things are driven to that exigent, that though I ſave thy life from famine, thou art certain to be a Slave to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Better it is, my Son, that thou now ſuſtain thy Mother who gave thee being, and ſtrike a terrour into thoſe curſed Souldiers, who have left me no other way of ſubſiſting; better that thou become an argument of pity unto future ages, and raiſe ſorrow in hearts not yet born. At theſe words ſhe cut the throat of her tender Infant, divided it in the middle, roſted one half and eat it, and laid aſide the reſt for another meal. She had no ſooner ended this lamentable Tragedy, but the Souldiers entred; who ſmelling the roſted fleſh began to threaten the Woman with death if ſhe diſcovered not her ſtore. But ſhe diſtracted with rage and horrour of her act, and deſiring nothing more than to accompany her dead Infant, without fear or being abaſhed at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this manner; Peace friends, we will ſhare like brothers: and ſaying this, ſhe fetched the half Child, and placed it upon the Table before them. At which hideous ſight the Souldiers being amazed and confounded conceiv'd ſo great horrour and compaſſion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51068:155"/>in their hearts, that they were not able to utter one word; but ſhe to the contrary ſtaring upon them with a wilde countenance full of fury and diſtraction, with a hoarſe and broken voice, ſpake in this manner; Why, how now Maſters, how comes this to paſs? is not this my Son, the fruit of my own body? is not this my act? why do ye not then eat, ſince I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun unto you? are you perhaps more nice than a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? are you more ſcrupulous than the Mother which bore it? for ſhame fall too; It is I who have eaten of it firſt, and 'tis I will bear you company in eating of the reſt. But they not being able to behold ſo horrible a ſpectacle fled out of doors, and left the miſerable Mother with that little which remained of her Son and all her wealth.</p>
                     <p>Unto theſe ſtories I ſhall add one more lamentable, in which will clearly appear unto what calamity hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life ſtands expoſed. It is written by <hi>William Paradin,</hi> a man of great learning and diligence, in a Treatiſe of things memorable in his time. He relates it thus. In the year 1528 men were grown ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in their lives, and ſo given over to all ſorts of wickedneſs, that notwithſtanding thoſe cruel and bloody warres which then raigned in moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> they humbled not themſelves, nor converted unto their Lord God, but became every day worſe, and fell into that extremity of vice and miſchief, that God being offended let looſe the ſharp arrows of his wrath and vengeance againſt the Realm of <hi>France</hi> with ſuch fury, that all men thought the final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Kingdom was then come. The want of corn, wine, and other fruits of the earth, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities of thoſe times were ſuch, as no Records ever mention the like. For five continued years, beginning at the year 1528, the four Seaſons of the year never kept their due and natural courſe, but were in that confuſion and diſorder, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Autumn came in Spring, and Spring in Autumn,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51068:156"/>Summer in Winter, and Winter in Summer; onely the unnatural Summer ſeemed to overcome the reſt of the parts of the year, and the heat doubled his forces againſt his enemy the cold: inſomuch as in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> when the cold ought to ſeaſon and mellow the earth with froſt and ſnow, the heat was ſo exceſſive, that the ground was parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and burnt up; which was a moſt prodigious thing to behold. In all thoſe five years there was no two dayes together of hard weather: neither thoſe ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, as to glaſe the waters with the leaſt ſhew of ice, by which exceſſive heat were bred in the bowels of the earth an infinite number of Vermin, Snails, Grubs, Worms, Lizards, and other creatures, which eat up the young and tender corn in the hearb, and much of it was devoured and conſumed in the husk before it ſprung up: which was the reaſon, that Wheat, which uſes to ſprout up divers ſterns from one grain, hardly put forth one or two, and thoſe ſo abortive, weak and dry, that in reaping time they gathered not half ſo much as they ſowed, and ſometimes nothing at all. This Famine laſted without ceaſe or intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion five whole years; a thing ſo lamentable, that it is impoſſible for them to imagine who have not ſeen it. The people were ſo oppreſſed and afflicted with this mortal hunger, and many other evils which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it, that it was pitiful to behold. For many who were rented men, and reaſonable well to paſs, left their Houſes and Granges, and went from door to door like wanderers, begging an alms for Gods ſake. Every day the number of the poor increaſed, in ſuch a manner as it was fearful to behold them, going up and down in troops impoſſible to remedy, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſuffer. For beſides the fear and hazard of being robbed, to which neceſſity might without ſin enforce them, the air was filled with ſtench and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from their breaths and bodies. To aſſwage their hunger, they fill'd themſelves with all ſorts of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51068:156"/>hearbs good and bad, wholeſome and poiſonous; they ranſackt all Gardens and Orchards, not ſparing ſo much as the roots and ſtalks of Cabbages, and of them found not enough to ſatisfie their ravenous appetites; and failing of Pot-hearbs in the Gardens, they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe which grew wilde in the Fields. Many of them boiled great caldrons full of Mallows and Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, mingling with them a little Bran if they could get it; and with this ſtuffed their bellies like Porks. It was a wonderful thing to ſee their many exquiſite inventions of making bread of ſeeds of Hearbs, of Roots, of Fearn, of Acorns, of Hay-ſeeds, forced and taught by hunger, the Miſtreſs of the ſloathful: ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying that, which is commonly ſaid, Want and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity makes men ſeek out remedies not thought on, as it made thoſe miſerable people, ſeeing Hogs feed upon the roots of Fearn, to trie whether they could make bread of it, robbing the food even from Swine to ſuſtain themſelves; Which evidently demonſtrates the wrath of God againſt the impurity and filthineſs of our ſins, ſince he permits men to fall into that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as to feed and feaſt with thoſe unclean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. From hence were ingendred many ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: great companies of Men, Women, Boyes and Girles, young and old, of all ages, went up and down the ſtreets naked, pale, ſhivering with cold, ſome ſwoln like Drums with Dropſies, others ſtretcht upon the ground half dead, and ready to draw the laſt gaſp, and of ſuch the Stables and Dunghils were full; others trembled as if they were infected with quickſilver, ſo as they appeared more like unto Ghoſts and Fantoms than living men. But above all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pity was to behold thouſands of Women, feeble, pale, and hunger-ſtarved, charged with an infinite number of their poor languiſhing Infants, which dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with hunger, could not ſo much as weep or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuccour from their ſorrowful and afflicted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who could onely help them with their pitiful
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51068:157"/>and compaſſionate looks, of which rivers of tears which ran from their eyes were a ſufficient witneſs; and this certainly was the moſt lamentable Scene of this miſerable Tragedy. The ſame <hi>William Paradin</hi> writes, that in <hi>Lonhans,</hi> a Town of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a poor woman, who with all the diligence, ſhe could uſe, had gotten a little morſel of black bread, which when ſhe was about to have eaten, her Infant unto whom ſhe gave ſuck, a boy of about a year old, who had never until then eaten bit, ſnatcht it out of her hand: at which the ſorrowful Mother admiring, beheld with what greedineſs he devoured that little piece of drie bread, as ſavourly as if it had been a March-pane; which when he had eaten, the Mother pickt up the crums that fell from his mouth, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eat them her ſelf, but the Infant fell into ſo great unquietneſs, and ſo violent a fit of crying, that ſhe was forced to leave them; and truly it ſeemed the Child knew the ſcarcity of that kind of food, and was therefore unwilling of a companion. What heart ſo hard and inhumane, that would not burſt at the ſight of ſo rueful a ſpectacle? The ſame Author fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writes, That in another Village near unto this, two women not finding any thing wherewith to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage their hunger, filled themſelves with Sea Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not knowing the property of that venemous hearb, which in ſuch a manner poiſoned them, that the extremities of their hands and feet became green as the skin of a Lizard, and a corrupt matter flowed from betwixt their nails and fleſh, for which not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving help ſo ſoon as was requiſite, they both died. There was no creature which became not an executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the wrath of God. The poor labourers left their Lands and Inheritances in hope to be relieved by the Rich, who had long ſince heaped up great quantities of corn in their Granaries: from whom at the firſt they bought bread at exceſſive rates; afterwards, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney failing, they ſold and pawned their Lands and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51068:157"/>for vile and low prices: for that which was worth an hundred crowns was ſold for ten. Such was the abominable and greedy avarice of the Uſurers, as if it were not enough for the poor to be ſcourged by the wrath of God, and to have the Elements and Creatures declared their enemies, but Men themſelves muſt become their Hangmen, and perſecute and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their own kinde. The Extortioners perceiving the deſired occaſion, which the perverſeneſs of the time offered them, loſt it not, but had Brokers and Factors in the Villages to buy the Inheritances of the poor at what price they pleaſed; which the afflicted willingly parted with, that they might have wherewith to eat; and together with it ſold their Cattle and Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe, and the very neceſſaries of their perſons: and would with all their hearts have pawned their bowels to have had wherewith to feed them. Beſides this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſaw not their Wheat meaſured, and were forced to take it as the Sellers pleaſed, who were no juſter in their meaſure than the price. There were ſome Uſurers, that bought a piece of Land for leſs money than the Notaries would take for drawing the Writings. After all this the poor Peaſants ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Wives and Children caſt out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to die in Hoſpitals. All thoſe miſeries, which fall not under imagination, are found in the life of man.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>GReater than all theſe calamities, is that of Warre, which of the three Scourges of God, wherewith he uſes to chaſtiſe Kingdomes, is the moſt terrible, as well becauſe it is comonly followed by the other two, as for that it brings along with it greater puniſhments, and, which is worſe, greater ſins, whereof plagues
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51068:158"/>are free, in which all endeavour to be reconciled with God, and even thoſe who are in health diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for death. The Peſtilence is ſent by God, who is all goodneſs and mercy, not paſſing through the hands of men, as warres doe. Wherefore <hi>David</hi> held it for a mercy that his people ſuffered peſtilence and not warre, becauſe he judged it better to fall into the hands of God then men. Famine alſo, although it brings with it ſome ſins, yet it leſſens others; though it be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many thefts, yet it ſutes not ſo much with pride and vanitie; neither doeth it permit ſo many ſorts of vices as are occaſioned by Warre. To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the calamities of Warre, it ſhall be ſufficient to inſtance in ſome of thoſe which have been inflicted upon <hi>Germany</hi> in our own times in theſe late Warres. A book whereof was ſet forth in another Countrey: whoſe Argument or Title I repeat not, (it is known) but it could not give an account of all. I ſhall onely pick out ſome few of them, ſetting apart thoſe places, which were diſpeopled and burnt, whereof there were 2000 Towns onely in the Dukedome of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The cruelties, which the conquering Souldiers inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor people, onely to diſcover where their wealth lay, are ſuch as were never heard of. One of their torments was, to tye a peece of match about their foreheads, and with a ſtick ſo to ſtraighten and ſcrew their temples, that the blood would often burſt forth, and ſometimes the very eyes and brains would ſtart forth of their broken ſculls. Others they left upon the floors of their houſes, or ſtretcht out upon a table bound hand and foot, and ſo expoſed them to be eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by hungry Dogs and Cats; and it often happened that the ſtarved Cats would tear their bellies, and feed upon their tripes and entrails. Others they hung up by the hands ſome diſtance from the ground, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire under them: Unto others they chopt off their noſes and ears with Chiſels, and wore them in their hatbands, holding it for a great gallantry, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:51068:158"/>him for the braveſt man, who was the cruelleſt beaſt. Unto others they poured water into their mouthes by a Tunnel, until they had fill'd their bodies like a Tun, and then ſat or ſtamped upon their bellies, until they made the water guſh out at their mouthes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils: Others they tied unto a poſt, and flead them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live like a St. <hi>Bartholmew.</hi> From ſome they pluckt out gobbets of fleſh with pincers; others they quartered and tore in pieces alive. They forced divers women, and after cut off their armes. Many were ſo barbarous as to eat Children; and one was known to take a ſmall Infant, and holding it by one leg with his left hand to tear it in ſunder with his right, and ſo to eat and ſuck the blood of it. The Priſoners which they took they bound not their hands, but made holes through their arms, and putting cords through them, dragged them after their horſes. The bodies of men, after that they had drawn out their guts and entrails, ſerved as Mangers wherein to feed their horſes. They robbed all, killed and burned men in their houſes; and ſome grave Magiſtrates, whoſe lives they ſpared, were made to ſerve and wait bare-headed at Table up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meaneſt Souldiers. Many, that they might not ſee and ſuffer thoſe miſeries, poiſoned themſelves; and divers Maids, flying from the Souldiers luſt, caſt themſelves headlong into rivers and were drowned. To theſe miſeries of Warre were added Peſtilence and Famine. Thoſe who fled from the Enemy died of the Plague or hunger in the open fields: and there was none to bury them, but dogs and ravenous birds which eat them. Neither had thoſe who died in houſes a more honourable Sepulcher, but were likewiſe devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by rats and vermin, who were grown ſo bold, as ſometime, if they were but one or two in a houſe, to eat them whileſt they lived, their weakneſs being ſuch as they were not able to defend themſelves. But the men in many places, were revenged of this affront, and eat the rats, of which there were publick Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51068:159"/>where they were ſold at high prices. Thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were eſteemed happy which had ſuch dainties to ſell; in other places nothing was to be had, but what every one provided by his own diligence. They often went together by the ears about a Rat, and cut one another in pieces in the quarrel: and happy was he that got a quarter of ſuch loathſome vermin. Horſe-fleſh was a great dainty, and they eſteemed themſelves very fortunate, who knew where to light on a dead Pack-horſe. Certain women found a dead Wolf all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and full of worms, and fed upon it as ſavourly, as if it had been a Kid. The bodies of Malefactors who hung upon Gibbets were not ſecure, nor did the dead eſcape that were buried in their Graves; both were ſtollen in the night to ſuſtain the living. Neither were they free from this danger who were alive; for two women were known to kill a third and eat her. After ſuch freſh examples it will not need to call to memory the calamities of former Warres. What is ſaid is ſufficient to expreſs the miſeries, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to humane life.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51068:159"/>to a beaſt is a fault of the will; ſo as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed paſſions make us worſe than beaſts.</q> It is not credible what one man ſuffers from the paſſions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

The man was ſo beſotted with his paſſion, that contemning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Biſhop, he went ſecretly one day to ſee his Miſtreſs, who having repented of what was paſt, entertained him with harſh language, reprehended his impudency, and commanded him to depart her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

If then our diſordered paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be ſo hurtful unto our own lives, how dangerous and prejudicial are they unto the lives of others? Certainly if all other misfortunes were wanting, thoſe were ſufficient, which are cauſed by humane-paſſions.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51068:161"/>concerning humane miſery. <q>I praiſed (ſaith he) the dead before the living; I judged him more happy than either, who was not born, nor had ſeen the evils which are done under the Sun.</q> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which offends humane nature more, than the follies and impertinencies of men, and the hatreds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices, violences, and inhumanities cauſed by their irregular paſſions. Whereupon ſome Philoſophers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane nature governed by paſſion and not by reaſon, wholly abhorred it. Amongſt whom <hi>Timon</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> was the principal beginner, and moſt earneſt Profeſſor of that Sect; for he did not only call himſelf the capital Enemy of Mankind, but confirmed his words by his actions; for he neither converſed nor dwelt with men, but lived in the Deſert amongſt wild beaſts, remote from Neighbourhood or Towns; neither would he be viſited by any, nor diſcourſe with any but an <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain called <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and that not for friendſhip or affection, but becauſe he hoped and foreſaw (as indeed it happened afterwards) that he would one day be the ruine of his Country, and the deſtruction of a multitude of men. Neither was he onely content with this averſion from men, but ſtudied and invented all ways poſſible to deſtroy them. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gallowſes to be made in his Gardens, wherein ſuch as were deſperate and weary of life might convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hang themſelves; and having occaſion ſome years after to make uſe of his Garden for the enlarging of his Houſe, he would not pull down his Gallowſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had called the people together to hear his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſuring them, that he had ſomething new and of importance to ſpeak unto them. The people, who having been long acquainted with his humour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſomething that was extraordinary, willingly aſſembled to hear him: to whom he ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. O <hi>Athenians,</hi> you are not ignorant, that many have made themſelves away in my Gardens. I have now occaſion to diſpoſe of them otherwiſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51068:161"/>fore thought good to tell you, that if any of you have a mind to hang your ſelves, that you do it quickly; And ſo without more words, with this loving offer concluded his Speech, and returned to his own houſe, where he ended his life in the ſame opinion, ever philoſophying of the miſery of man. And when the pangs of death came upon him, abhorring mankinde even unto the laſt gaſp, he commanded that his body ſhould not be interr'd in the earth, as in the common Element, wherein uſually were buried the bodies of others, afraid leſt his bones ſhould lye near or be touched by men though dead: but that they ſhould make his Sepulcher upon the brink of the Sea, that tho fury of the waves might hinder the approach of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and that they ſhould grave upon it this Epitaph, which is related by <hi>Plutarch; After my miſerable life they buried me in this deep water. Reader, deſire not to know my name. The Gods confound thee.</hi> This Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher wanted faith and charity, not diſtinguiſhing betwixt the Malice of man, and his Nature: having reaſon to abhorre that, and to love this. Yet by theſe extravagant demonſtrations he gave us to underſtand how monſtrous are our paſſions, and how worthy of hate, when they are not ordered and governed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And certainly all Chriſtians ought to deſire the deſtruction of the pomp and pride of men, as <hi>Timon</hi> did of their perſons, their ſuperfluous gallantry, their unlawful pleaſures, their oſtentation of riches, their vain titles of honour, their raging envy, their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered choler, their unjuſt revenges, their unbridled paſſions. Thoſe ought to die and be deſtroyed, that the men may live.</p>

                     <p>So many are the miſeries of life that they cannot all be numbered. Death, which is called by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> The greateſt of evils, is by many eſteemed a leſſer evil than
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:51068:162"/>life: the many evils in this ſurpaſſing the greatneſs of the evil in that; and therefore many have thought it better to ſuffer the greateſt, which is death, than to ſuffer ſo many though leſſer, which are in life. For this reaſon one calls Death, The laſt and greateſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, becauſe though in it ſelf it be the greateſt evil, yet it cures all others, and therefore preſcribes the hopes of it, as an efficacious remedy and comfort in the afflictions of life. But becauſe this comfort is not reliſhed by all, the fear of death being ſo natural, and the dangers and many waves unto it accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the many miſeries of life, therefore ſome prime Philoſophers could find out no other remedy for evils than to deſpair of their remedy. Wherefore <hi>Seneca,</hi> when a great Earthquake happened in his time in <hi>Campania,</hi> wherein <hi>Pompeios</hi> a famous City, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Towns were ſunk and many people loſt, and the reſt of the Inhabitants diſtracted with fear and and grief fled from their Country, as if they had been baniſht, he adviſed them to return home, and aſſured them that there was no remedy for the evils of this life, and that the dangers of death were unavoidable. And truly, if well conſidered, what ſecurity can there be in life, when the Earth, which is the Mother of the living, is unfaithful to them, and ſprouts out miſeries and deaths even of whole Cities? what can be ſecure in the World, if the World it ſelf be not, and the moſt ſolid parts of it ſhake? If that, which is onely immoveable and fixt for to ſuſtain the living, tremble with Earthquakes, if what is proper to the Earth, which is to be firm, be unſtable and betray us, where ſhall our fears find a refuge? When the roof of the houſe ſhakes we may flie into the fields, but when the world ſhakes, whither ſhall we goe? What comfort can we have, when fear cannot find a gate to flie out at? Cities reſiſt Enemies with the ſtrength of their walls: Tempeſts finde a ſheltet in the Haven: The covering of Houſes defend us from rains and ſnows:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:51068:162"/>In the time of plague we may change places; but from the whole Earth who can flie, and therefore from dangers? For this reaſon <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, Not to have a remedy may ſerve us as a comfort in our evils; for Fear is fooliſh without Hope. Reaſon baniſhes fear in thoſe who are wiſe; and in thoſe, who are not, deſpair of remedy gives a kind of ſecurity, at leaſt takes away fear. He that will fear nothing, let him think that all things are to be feared. See what ſlight things endanger us; even thoſe which ſuſtain life, lay ambuſhes for us. Meat and drink, without which we cannot live, take away our lives. It is not wiſdom therefore to fear ſwallowing by an Earthquake, and not to fear the falling of a tile. In death all ſorts of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are equal. What imports it whether one ſingle ſtone kills thee, or a whole Mountain oppreſs thee? death conſiſts in the ſouls leaving of the bodies, which often happens by ſlight accidents,</p>
                     <p>But Chriſtians in all the dangers and miſeries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, have other comforts to lay hold on, which are a good conſcience, hope of glory, conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Divine will, and the imitation and example of Jeſus Chriſt. From theſe four he ſhall in life have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in death ſecurity, in both comfort, and in eternity a reward. <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> being much oppreſſed with his laſt infirmity whereof he died, ſome who were preſent endeavoured to comfort him with ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical reaſons and ſentences of the Stoicks, wherein that moſt learned man was much ſtudied, as appears in his Book of the Introduction to Stoical learning; unto whom he anſwered in this moſt Chriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Vain are all thoſe conſolations; and pointing unto an Image of Chriſt crucified, ſaid, This is the true comfort and true patience. And preſently with a ſigh, which roſe from the bottom of his heart, ſaid; My Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt give me Chriſtian patience. This comfort we ought to have, who were redeemed by ſo loving a Lord, That, conſidering our
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51068:163"/>ſins are greater than the pains of this life, and that the Son of God hath ſuffered farre greater, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſin, he hath deſerved to convert the miſeries of this life, which are occaſioned by ſin, into inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſatisfaction for our ſins, drawing health out of infirmity, and an antidote out of poiſon.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo draw from what is ſaid, how unjuſt was the complaint of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> that nature had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a longer life unto many birds and beaſts, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man. If our life were leſs troubleſome, he had ſome reaſon; but it being ſo fraught with miſeries, he might rather think that life the happieſt which was ſhorteſt. Wherefore, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaid to <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> it is better to die young and die well, than to die old and die ill. This voyage being of neceſſity, the felicity of it conſiſts not in being long, but being proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and that we at laſt arrive in the deſired Port. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Johan.</note> that to die is to be eaſed of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthens, which we bear in this life: and that the happineſs is not to leave it late in the evening of our age, but that when we die they charge us not with a greater load. Let a man live ten years, or let him live a thouſand, death (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith) gives him the title of happy or unfortunate. If he live a thouſand years in ſorrow, it is a great unhappineſs: but greater, if he live them ill, though with content; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſing ſo many miſeries, we cannot complain of God for having given us a ſhort life, but of our ſelves for having made it a bad one.<note place="margin">Ambr. Ser. qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſ.</note> Finally, as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſayes, Our life being compaſſed with ſo many miſeries, as that death ſeems rather a ſhelter for evils than a puniſhment, God was pleaſed that it ſhould be ſhort, that the vexations and misfortunes of it, which cannot be counterpoiſed with any joyes of the earth, might be more ſupportable. At leaſt if this life with ſo many miſeries do not diſpleaſe us, yet let the eternal with all her felicities content us better; and let us not endeavour leſs for the immortal life of heaven, than
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51068:163"/>we doe for this mortal one of earth. And therefore, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Auguſ. trac. <hi>5.</hi> in Johan. hom. <hi>57.</hi>

Wherefore doeſt thou wax proud, Duſt and aſhes, whoſe conception was in ſin, whoſe birth in miſery, whole life in pain, and whoſe death neceſſity? wherefore doeſt thou ſwell and adorn thy fleſh with precious things, which in few dayes is to be devoured by worms; and doeſt not rather adorn thy ſoul with good works, which is to be preſented in heaven before God and his Angels?</q> All this is ſpoken by St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> which every man ought to take as ſpoken unto himſelf.</p>

                        <q>A fantaſme of time; whoſe inſtability is thus declared by <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea.</hi> Our nature from our birth until our death is unſtable, and as it were fantaſtical, which if you ſtrive to comprehend, is like water gathered in the palm of the hand; the more you graſp it, the more you ſpill it. In the ſame manner thoſe mutable and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51068:165"/>tranſitory things, the more you conſider them with reaſon, the more they flye from you. Things ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible being in a perpetual flux, are ſtill doing and undoing; ſtill generating and corrupting, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remain the ſame. For, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ſayes, as it is impoſſible to enter twice into the ſame river, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame water remains not, but new ſucceeds ſtill as the firſt paſſes, ſo if you conſider twice this mortal ſubſtance, you ſhall not both times find it the ſame, but with an admirable ſwiftneſs of change it is now extended, now contracted; but it is not well ſaid to ſay Now and Now; for in the ſame time it loſes in one part, and gains in another, and is another thing than what it is, in ſo much as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſts. The Embrion, which is framed from ſeed, quickly becomes an Infant, from thence a Boy, from thence a Young-man, from thence an Old, and then decrepit; and ſo the firſt ages being paſt and corrupted by new ones which ſucceed, it comes at laſt to die. How ridiculous then are men to fear one death, who have already died ſo many, and are yet to die more. Not onely, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ſaid, The corruption of fire is the generation of air, but this appears more plainly in our ſelves; for from youth corrupted is engendred man, and from him the old man; from the boy corrupted is engendered the youth, and from the infant the boy, and from who was not yeſterday, he who is to day; and of him, who is to day, he who ſhall be to morrow: ſo as he never remains the ſame, but in every moment we change, as it were, with various phantaſms in one common matter. For if we be ſtill the ſame, how come we to delight in things we did not before? we now love and abhorre after another manner than formerly: we now praiſe and diſpraiſe other things than we did before: we uſe other words, and are moved with other affections; we do not hold the ſame form, nor paſs the ſame judgement
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:51068:166"/>we did; and how is it poſſible, that without change in our ſelves, we ſhould thus change in our moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections? certainly he who ſtill changes is not the ſame, and he who is not the ſame cannot be ſaid to be, but in a continual mutation ſlides away like water. The ſenſe is deceived with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what is, and thinks that to be which is not. Where ſhall we then finde true being, but in that onely which is eternal, and knows no beginning, which is incorruptible, which is not changed with time? Time is moveable, and joyned with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable matter; glides away like a current, and like a veſſel of generation and corruption retains nothing: in ſo much as the firſt and the laſt, that which was, and that which ſhall be are nothing, and that which ſeems preſent, paſſes like lightning. Wherefore as time is defined to be the meaſure of the motion of things ſenſible, and as time never is, nor can be, ſo we may with the like reaſon ſay, that things ſenſible do not remain, nor are, nor have any being.</q> All this is from <hi>Euſebius;</hi> which <hi>David</hi> declared more briefly and ſignificantly when he ſaid, That man whileſt he lived in this life, was an Univerſal vanity. Wherefore St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">In laud.

                     <p>Let man therefore reflect upon all which hath been ſaid; let him behold himſelf in this glaſs: let him ſee wherefore he preſumes, wherefore he afflicts himſelf for things of the earth, which are ſo ſmall in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo prejudicial unto him. With reaſon did the Prophet ſay, <hi>In vain doth man trouble himſelf;</hi> Upon which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with great admiration ſpeaks in this manner.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Pſ. <hi>36.</hi>

                        <q>Man troubles himſelf and loſes his end; he troubles himſelf, conſumes and melts to nothing, as if he had never been born; he troubles himſelf, and before he attains reſt is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed; he is inflamed like fire, and is reduced to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:51068:166"/>aſhes like flax; he mounts on high like a tempeſt, and like duſt is ſcattered and diſappears; he is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled like a flame, and vaniſhes like ſmoke; he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his beauty like a flower, and withers like hay; he ſpreads himſelf as a cloud, and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as a drop; he ſwells like a bubble of water, and and goes out like a ſpark; he is troubled, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries nothing about him but the filth of riches; he is troubled onely to gain dirt; he is troubled and dies without fruit of his vexations. His are the troubles, others the joyes; his are the cares, others the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; his are the afflictions, others the fruit; his are the heart-burſtings, others the delights; his are the curſes, others have the reſpect and reverence; againſt him the ſighs and exclamations of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted are ſent up to Heaven, and againſt him the tears of the poor are poured out, and the riches and abundance remains with others; he ſhall howl and be tormented in hell, whileſt others ſing, triumph, and vainly conſume his eſtate. In vain do living men trouble themſelves. Man is he who enjoyes a life but lent him, and that but for a ſhort time; Man is but a debt of death, which is to be paid without delay; a living Creature, who is in his will and appetite untamed, a miſchief taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Maſter, a voluntary ambuſh, ſubtle in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, witty in iniquity, prone to covetouſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable in the deſire of what is anothers, of a boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, and full of inſolent temerity; in his words fierce, but eaſily quailed; bold, but quickly maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; an arrogant clay, an inſolent duſt, and a ſparkle which in a moment is extinguiſhed; a flame which quickly dies, a light which vaniſhes into air, a dead leaf, withered hay, faded graſs, a nature which conſumes it ſelf, to day threatens, and to morrow dies; to day abounds in wealth, and is to morrow in his grave; to day hath his brows circled with a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and to morrow is with worms; he is to day,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51068:167"/>and to morrow ceaſes to be; triumphs and rejoyces to day, and to morrow is lamented; immeaſurably inſolent in proſperity, and in adverſity admits no comfort; who knows not himſelf, yet is curious in ſearching what is above him; is ignorant of what is preſent, and ſcoffs at what's to come; he who is mortal by nature, and out of pride thinks himſelf eternal; he who is an open houſe of perturbations, a game of divers infirmities, a concourſe of daily calamities, and a receptacle of all ſorrow. O how great is the Tragedy of our baſeneſs! and how many things have I ſaid? But it cannot better be declared than by the voice of the Prophet: In vain doth man who lives trouble himſelf. For truly the things of this life, which ſhine and gliſter moſt, are of leſs profit than a putrified Carcaſe.</q> This is of St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome,</hi> in which he clearly ſets forth the miſery of Man, the ſhortneſs of his life, and the vanity of things temporal.</p>

                     <p>And that the perfect knowledge of our ſelves may not be wanting unto us, Man is not onely thus vile and baſe, whileſt he lives, and much more being dead, but even his Soul, whileſt it remains in his Body, is not of much greater eſteem. For although the Soul be of it ſelf of a moſt noble ſubſtance, yet our vices do ſo much vilifie it, that they make it more abominable than the Body. And without doubt the Soul, when it is dead in mortal ſin, is more corrupt and ſtinking in the ſight of the Angels, than a Body dead eight days agoe; for if that Body be full of worms, this is full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and vices. And even whileſt the Soul lives, and is free from any mortal ſin, yet by committing thoſe, which are but venial, it becomes full of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and although it be not dead, yet it is more weak, feeble, and languiſhing than a ſick Body; and if a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51068:167"/>man knew himſelf well, he would be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the miſery of his Soul, than at that of his Fleſh. The devout Father <hi>Alfonſo Roderiguez,</hi> a moſt excellent Maſter in matters of ſpirit, writes of a holy Woman, who deſired light from God to know in what condition ſhe was: and ſaw in her ſelf ſuch uglineſs and deformity, that ſhe was not able to ſuffer it, and therefore beſought God again, ſaying, Not ſo much, O Lord, for I ſhall faint and be diſmaid. Father Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>John d'Avila</hi> ſaith, that he knew a perſon who often had importuned God to diſcover unto him, what he was. It pleaſed God to open his eyes but a very little, and yet that little had like to have coſt him dear: for he beheld himſelf ſo ugly and abominable, that he cried out aloud, Lord of thy mercy take from before mine eyes this mirrour; I deſire not any more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my figure. <hi>Donna Sancha Carillo,</hi> that moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſervant of Chriſt, after ſhe had led a moſt perfect and admirable life, beſought our Lord to give her a ſight of her Soul, that ſeeing the filthineſs of her ſins, ſhe might be further moved to abhorre them. Our Lord was pleaſed to grant her requeſt, and ſhewed it her in this form. One night, as ſhe ſat alone in her Sala the door open, there paſſed before her an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hermite, his hair all gray, and in his hand a ſtaffe to ſupport him. She amazed at the ſight of ſuch a man, in ſuch a habit, at ſo unſeaſonable an hour, was a little ſurpriſed with fear; yet recollecting her ſelf, ſaid unto him, Father, what ſeek ye for here? to whom he anſwered, Lift up my Cloak, and you ſhall ſee. She did ſo, and beheld a little Girle ſickly, pale, and weak, with the face all covered over with flies. She took it in her armes, and demanded of him, Father, what is this? Doeſt thou not remember, replyed the Hermite, when thou earneſtly deſired'ſt of our Lord, that he would give thee a view of thy Soul? Behold the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of it; after this manner it is. This ſaid, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition vaniſhed, and ſhe remained ſo confuſed and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51068:168"/>affrighted, that it ſeemed unto her (accordingly as ſhe after confeſſed) that all her bones were diſplaced with ſuch grief and pain, as, had it not been for the great favour and mercy of God, it had been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her to endure it. She paſſed that night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overwhelmed with the waves of her ſad and troubled thoughts. The manner of that Girle ſo feeble and diſcoloured afflicted her extremely, contemplating it as the image of her Soul; eſpecially when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the face covered with thoſe impertinent and troubleſome little creatures, her grief was doubled: and it ſeemed unto her as if it had ſmelt like ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was dead, or ſome old ſore: which made her ſend up a thouſand ſighs unto heaven, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a remedy and mercy from our Lord. No ſooner did the day ſo much deſired by her appear, but ſhe repaired inſtantly unto her Confeſſor, a perſon of great vertue and learning, and deſired him with many tears to explicate unto her the meaning of that Viſion, and to tell her whether thoſe little creatures did ſignifie any grievous and hidden ſins, which her ſoul knew not of. The Confeſſor took ſome ſhort time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his anſwer unto our Saviour: which done, he returned and ſaid unto her, Madam, trouble not your ſelf, but render hearty thanks unto God for the favour which he hath done you; and know that the feebleneſs, which appeared in the Image of your Soul, was an effect of venial ſins, which weaken, but kill not; cool, but extinguiſh not the charity in our Souls; for if they had been mortal ſins, the Girle would have been dead: for thoſe deprive the Soul wholly of life; thoſe which be venial onely take away our fervour and promptneſs in the ſervice of God, and the perfect accompliſhing of his holy Law. If then the Souls of ſo great Servants of God are ſo full of miſeries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can miſerable man boaſt, ſince he is ſo both in ſoul and body?</p>

                     <p> How deceitful are all things Temporal.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom what hath hitherto been ſaid may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected how great a lie and cozenage is all that which paſſes in time, and that the things of the earth, beſides that they are baſe, inconſtant and tranſitory, are alſo deceitful and full of danger. This is ſignified unto us in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> by the Harlot, by which was denoted humane proſperity, who ſat upon that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Beaſt, which is the World. And amongſt other Ornaments, as the Scripture ſayes, ſhe was adorned with gilded gold; which gives us to underſtand her falſhood: Since it was not true and fine gold which ſhe wore, but falſe and counterfeited; for although it ſeemed gold, it was but alchimy; and yet being gilt ſhe ſold it for true gold. So the Proſperity of the World comes decked with the goods of the earth, which ſhe fells for true goods, ſetting them forth as great, ſecure and laſting, when they are nothing leſs. All is but deceit and cozenage; which is well expreſt by <hi>Seneca,</hi> when he ſayes: <q>That is onely good which is honeſt; other goods are falſe and adulterate.</q> What greater falſhood and deceit, than to make thoſe things, which are moſt vile and baſe, to appear ſo precious, and of ſuch eſteem, that men pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater, and being more changeable than the Moon, to appear conſtant and ſecure, in ſo much as we remain ſo ſatisfied with them, as if they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to change, and being fading and corruptible we ſeek after them as if they were eternal and immortal, remembring nothing leſs than their end and ours, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting wholly that they are to periſh and we to die? It is evident they are falſe, ſince they promiſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:51068:169"/>what they neither have nor are. Thoſe who work in proſpective will ſo paint a room, that the light entring onely through ſome little hole, you ſhall perceive beautiful and perfect figures and ſhapes; but if you open the windows and let in a full light, at moſt you ſhall ſee but ſome imperfect lines and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. So the things of this World ſeem great and beautiful unto thoſe, who are in darkneſs and have but little light of heaven, but thoſe, who enjoy the perfect light of truth and faith, finde nothing in them of ſubſtance. The felicity of this life is but a fiction, and a ſhadow of true happineſs, and by that name is often qualified in holy Scripture, which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expreſſes the nature of it. For the ſhadow is not a body, but a reſemblance of a body, and ſeeming to be ſomething, is nothing. The inconſtancy alſo and ſpeedy change of humane things deſerves this name: becauſe the ſhadow is alwayes altering, and ends on a ſodain. And as the ſhadow when it is at length, and can increaſe no further, is neareſt the end: ſo tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods and humane fortunes, when they are mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as high as the ſtarres, are then neareſt to vaniſh, and diſappear ſodainly. And therefore one of the friends of <hi>Job</hi> faid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaw the fool that he had taken deep rooting, and inſtantly I curſed his beauty;</hi> for the more firm he appeared to ſtand, the more near he was unto his fall. And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, he ſaw the Sinner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as a Cedar, but he endured no longer than he turned his eyes.</p>
                  <p>What is to deceive, but to publiſh that for truth which is not, and to promiſe that which ſhall never be accompliſhed? I leave to the witneſs of every one, how often the iſſue of their hopes have proved vain, not finding in what they deſired that content which they expected. In riches they hope for peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but meet with nothing but unquietneſs and cares, and many times with dangers and loſſes. For this Chriſt our Redeemer called riches deceits, ſaying,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:51068:169"/>that the Divine Word was choaked with the falſhood and deceit of riches. He is not content with calling them falſe and deceitful, but calls them falſhoods and deceits; for what can be more falſe and perfidious, then promiſing one thing to perform juſt the contrary? The proſperity of this world promiſes us goods, and gives us evils; promiſes us eaſe, and gives us cares; promiſes ſecurity, and gives us danger; promiſes us great contents, and gives us great vexations; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us a ſweet life, and gives us a bitter. With reaſon it is ſaid in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> that the bread,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 21.</note> which the worldly man eats, ſhall be converted into the gall of Aſpes; becauſe that in thoſe things, which ſeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his life as the bread of its mouth, he ſhall meet his death, and when he hopes for pleaſure, he ſhall finde gall, and no morſel, which ſhall not leave ſome bitterneſs behinde it. There is no felicity upon earth, which carries not its counterpoiſe of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: no happineſs, which mounts ſo high, which is not depreſſed by ſome calamity. For as they anciently painted humane Fancy in the form of a young man with one arm lifted up with wings, as if it meant to flye towards heaven, and the other weighed down by ſome great weight, which hindred it from riſing; ſo humane felicity, how high ſoever it ſoars, hath ſtill ſomething to depreſs it.</p>

                     <p>If we will evidently ſee how deceitfull are the things of this world, this is a convincing argument, that no man, after he hath enjoyed what he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is content with his condition, which apparently ſhews their deceit; neither doth any man ceaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more, though he poſſeſs the greateſt and moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fortune in the world; which alſo argues their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſince they, ſatisfie not thoſe who poſſeſs them. No man but envyes the life of ſome other, and grievs
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:51068:170"/>and complains of his own, though far more happy. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who was arrived at the height of humane felicity,<note place="margin">Euſeb. in Orat. de laudibus Conſtan.</note> ſaid, his life was ſomething more honourable than that of Neat-heards and Shepheards, but much more painful and troubleſome. <hi>Alfonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> ſaid the life of Kings was the life of Aſſes, for the great burthens which they bear. So as in the book of <hi>Job</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Job.</hi> 22.</note> that <hi>the Giants groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the waters.</hi> In which place (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates it) by the Giants are underſtood the mighty ones of the earth, upon whom it ſends troubles and vexations, (for ſo the name of Waters ſignifie in that place of holy Scripture) which makes them groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intolerable weight of them. They are like the Giants, which in great Cities are ſhewed at their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts; that which appears, is ſome great and ſtately bulk covered with Gold and Silks: but that which appears not, is the little poor man, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it upon his ſhoulders, ſweating, groaning, tyred and half dead with the weight. The Sumpter-mules of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> at their firſt coming to Court are loaden with great wealth of Silver, Veſſel, Tiſſue-Beds, and rich Hangings, their Sumpter-clothes imbroidered, their Winding-ſtaves of ſilver, their Cords of ſilk, with their great Plumes, their Bells, Boſſes, and other Furniture. But although their load be rich and ſumptuous, yet in fine it is a load and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes them, and they are ready to faint and ſink under the weight of it. So is Honour, Empire, and Command. Even King <hi>David</hi> confeſſed as much, and ſayes, That his loyns were (as it were) disjoynted, and he was bruiſed and wearied with the burthen. Some Kings have ſaid that, which is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Stobaeus</hi> of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Stob. Ser. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> who, when he was crowned King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſaid, O Crown more noble than happy! if men knew how full thou art of cares and dangers, no man would take thee up, though he ſhould finde thee in the Streets. And <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:51068:170"/>to expreſs the anxieties of the life of Kings, ſaid, it was like that of condemned perſons, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hour expect death. This is ſignified by the Cup of Gold, which the Woman (that is Proſperity) who ſat upon the Monſter with ſeaven heads, (that is the World) held in her hand; which although it made a fair ſhew, yet was full of abomination: becauſe there is none, who ſpeaks not ill of his own condition, and many who ſeem moſt fortunate, abhorre their own lot, although it appear glorious unto others. <hi>Salomon</hi> was the King who moſt enjoyed the goods of this life; for he reſolved to ſatiate himſelf with delights, even until he ſurfeited. He had a thouſand Wives, whereof 700 Queens, and 300 Concubins; he had ſumptuous Buildings and Palaces, Gardens, Orchards, Houſes of Pleaſure, Woods, Groves, Fiſh-ponds, excellent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Men and Women Singers, the greateſt and beſt ordered Court in the World, his Service and Veſſels of gold and ſilver ſo ſumptuous, as it cauſed admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Queen of <hi>Saba:</hi> His Cavalry conſiſted of 40000 horſe, with furniture ſutable, in perpetual pay. The Treaſure, which his Father <hi>David</hi> left him, was according to <hi>Budaeus</hi> ten times greater than that of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Finally, he arrived unto that point of happineſs and felicity in all kindes, that he himſelf admired it, and acknowledged himſelf for the moſt fortunate Prince in the world, and ſaid,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Who ſhall feed like me? and who ſhall abound in all delights and pleaſures as I doe?</hi> Yet in all this proſperity, than which greater cannot be imagined by man, when he ſeriouſly caſt his eyes upon it, he ſaid, All was vanity and affliction of ſpirit; and was ſo diſcontented with his life, that he confeſſed it was tedious unto him, and that he deteſted the care he had taken about it: and envying the poor Laborer, judged it was better for one to eat of what he got by the ſweat of his brows. If then ſuch excceſs of fortune, felicity, wealth, honour and pleaſure deceived ſo wiſe a King as <hi>Salomon,</hi> who
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51068:171"/>will not he deceived? what ſhall we expect from ſome little part of felicity, when this flood of fortune could not beſtow a contented and quiet life?

But as they are not the things which they ſeem, ſo they afford not what we expect, and therefore no man is content with what he has, that ſtill appearing better which is anothers.</p>
                     <p>And this proceeds from the deceit of humane things, that obtaining what we deſire, and not finding that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which we expected, we envy the condition of others, thinking we ſhould there meet with that content which is not to be had at home, which ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much trouble, we at laſt come to know our errour, and find their condition worſe than our own. This is well expreſt by Antiquity in a fiction it made full of doctrine, wherein it feigned that the <hi>Cretans</hi> preſented a Petition to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that ſince he was born in their Country, he would be pleaſed to exempt them from the trouble and labours endured by others. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> anſwered, that this was a Priviledge of thoſe who were in heaven, and could not be granted to them who lived upon earth. Whereupon they framed a ſecond Supplication, that it might be lawful for them to change and truck their labours and cares one with another. This was granted. Whereupon the next Fair-day every one truſſing up his own troubles in a Fardel, and loading himſelf, brought them to the Market-place: but began, before they bargained, to ſearch and look into thoſe of others, and finding them more heavy and grievous than their own, every one returned to his houſe as wiſe as he came. The remedy of afflictions is not to flye from them, but to turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, ſince they happen unto us for our forſaking of him. And it was a moſt high counſel of the Divine Providence, that no man ſhould want afflictions, that ſo he might know his ſins: and hoping onely for eaſe
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:51068:171"/>and comfort in the next life and in God, he might acknowledge and onely ſerve him. Wherefore the Prophet <hi>Oſee</hi> ſaith, that God deals with us,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Oſee</hi> 2.</note> as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a Wife, who had forſaken him, and ſought after ſtrange Lovers, who ſowed thorns in her paths, that being wounded ſhe might ſay, I will return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my firſt Spouſe; ſo God ſows Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in the goods of this life, that the Soul being afflicted may repent and turn unto him.</p>
                     <p>Another argument of the great deceit of temporal things is this, that the more we poſſeſs them, the more we covet them, and alter the experience of their little ſubſtance and power to ſatisfie our hearts, yet ſtill we deſire and gape after them. It is evident that this is a great cozenage, and a certain kind of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, by which they ſnatch away humane affections at ſuch a time as they ſhould moſt avoid them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſatisfies, and yet we deſire that which does not ſatisfie. How vain then are they, ſince when we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them, they content us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not, yet we ſtill deſire more? All the power and felicity of his Kingdom, nor the greatneſs of his Palaces, nor being Lord of ſo many Cities and Fields could content <hi>Achab,</hi> unleſs he enjoyed the little Vineyard of his poor neighbour; which being denied, he fell ſick with grief and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, flung himſelf upon his bed, and for meer rage and madneſs forbore to eat. O goods of the earth, where is your greatneſs, ſince the wealth of a rich Kingdome could not fill the heart of one man, but left it empty to deſire more; and the want of one onely thing had more power to afflict him, than ſo many goods joyned together to content him? All things are as vain as this, ſince they cannot give us that for which we ſeek them;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Finally, from ail which is ſpoken either in this or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:51068:172"/>the former Books, may be drawn that conſolation of in the Emperour <hi>Marous Aurclius</hi> in his Philoſophy,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> in fine p. <hi>185.</hi>
                        </note> where he ſayes, <q>The time of humane life is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the nature ſlippery, the ſenſes darkned, the temperature of the whole body eaſily corrupted, the Soul wandring, the fortune, what it ſhall be, hard to conjecture, the fame uncertain, and, to be ſhort, thoſe things, which belong unto the body, have the nature of a river, and thoſe, which belong unto the mind, are as ſmoke or a dream. Life is a warre and a peregrination, fame after death is forgotten. What is there then that can guide unto ſecurity. There is nothing but Philoſophy, which conſiſts in this, that thou conſerve a mind without wound or ſtain, entire and undefiled, ſuperiour to all grief and pleaſure, that thou do nothing without a good end, nothing feignedly or falſely, and that thou regard not what another man does or has to doe: Beſides, that all things, which happen, thou receive as ſent from thence, from whence thou thy ſelf art derived; Finally, that thou attend death with a quiet and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate minde.</q> This is from that great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</p>

                  <p>THe leaſt evil, which we receive from the goods of this world, is to deceive and fruſtrate our hopes: and he comes well off, whom they forſake onely with a mock. For there are many who not onely fail of what they deſire, but meet with what they abhorre, and in place of eaſe and content meet with trouble and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and inſtead of life finde death, and that which

To how many have riches, which they loved as their life, been an occaſion of death? This is the calamity of the goods of the earth: which the Wiſe-man noted when he ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccle.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Another dangerous evil I beheld under the Sun, riches preſerved for the deſtruction of their owner.</hi> This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and incurable infirmity of riches, that when they are poſſeſſed with affection, they turn into the ruine of their poſſeſſors either in ſoul or body, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in both: in ſo much as we are not to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on temporal goods as vain and deceitful, but as Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides and our betrayers. With much reaſon the two great Prophets <hi>Iſaias</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> compare <hi>Egypt,</hi> (by which is ſignified the world and humane proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) unto a reed, which if you lean upon, it breaks, and the ſplinters wound your hands. No leſs brittle than a reed are temporal goods, but more dangerous. Beſides the other faults, wherewith they may be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, a very great one is the hurts they doe to life it ſelf, for whoſe good they are deſired; and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not onely hurtful unto the life eternal, but prejudicial even unto the temporal. How many for their deſire to obtain them have loſt the happineſs of heaven, and the quiet felicity of the earth, enduring before death a life of death, and by their cares, griefs, fears, troubles, labours and afflictions, which are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed even by the greateſt abundance and felicity, before they enter into the hell of the, other world, ſuffer a hell in this? And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> writes in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.</note> that Death and Hell were caſt into a lake of fire, becauſe the life of ſinners, of whom he ſpeaks, according to the letter, is a death and hell; and he ſayes, that this Life and this Hell ſhall be caſt into the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51068:173"/>other hell: and he who places his felicity in the goods of the earth, ſhall paſs from one death unto another, and from one hell unto another. Let us look upon the condition, whereunto <hi>Aman</hi> was brought by his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of temporal fortunes, into ſo exceſſive a pride, that becauſe he was denied a reſpect which was no wayes due unto him, he lived a life of death, ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in his breaſt a hell of rage, madneſs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: nothing in this life, as he himſelf confeſt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him eaſe or content. What condition more like unto death and hell than this? for as in hell there is a privation of all joyes and delights, ſo oftentimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the greateſt felicities upon earth. The ſame which <hi>Aman</hi> confeſſed <hi>Dionyſius</hi> felt when he was King of <hi>Sicily:</hi> to wit that he took no content at all in the greateſt delights of his Kingdom.<note place="margin">Tull. in Tuſcul. q. Boet. l. de conſol.</note> And therefore <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſayes, that if we could take away the veil from thoſe who ſit in Thrones, are clad in Purple, and compaſſed about with Guards of Souldiers, we ſhould ſee the chains in which their Souls are enthralled; conformable unto which is that of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that in name onely they are Princes, but in every thing elſe Slaves. A marvelous thing it is, that a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with delights, paſtimes, and pleaſures, ſhould joy in nothing, and in the middeſt of dancing, drinking, feaſting, and dainty fair ſhould find a hell in his heart. That in hell amongſt ſo many torments ſinners ſhould not finde comfort, is no marvail at all; but that in this life in the middeſt of felicity and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all delights he ſhould finde no ſatisfaction is a great myſtery. A great miſchief than is humane proſperity, that amongſt all its contents it affords no room for one true one. But this is Divine providence, that as the Saints, who deſpiſed what was temporal, had in their ſouls in the very middeſt of torments a heaven of joy and pleaſure, as St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> who in the middeſt of flames found a Paradice in his heart: ſo the Sinner, who neither eſteems nor loves any
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51068:173"/>thing beſides thoſe of the world, ſhould alſo in the middeſt of his regalo's and delights finde a life of hell and torments, anticipating that, whereunto after death he is to enter and be confined. So great are the cares and griefs occaſioned by the goods of the earth, that they oppreſs thoſe who moſt enjoy them, and ſhut up the door to all mirth, leaving them in a ſad night of ſorrow. This is that which was repreſented unto the Prophet <hi>Zacharias,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.</note> when before that the Devils came to fetch away the Veſſel, wherein the woman was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, to be carried into a ſtrange Region in the Land of <hi>Sanaar,</hi> there to dwell for ever, the mouth of it was ſtopt up with a talent of Lead, and ſhe impriſoned in darkneſs and obſcurity; ſignifying thereby, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a worldling is ſnatcht away by the Devils to be carried into the mournful land of hell, even in this life he is hood-winked and placed in ſo great a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he ſees not one beam of the light of truth; ſo that no content or compleat joy can ever enter into his heart.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon why the goods of this life are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and incommodious even to life it ſelf, is for the many dangers they draw along with them, the obligations wherein they engage us, the cares which they require, the fears which they cauſe, the affronts which they occaſion, the ſtraights whereunto they put us, the troubles which they bring along with them, the diſordinate deſires which accompany them, and finally the evil conſcience which they commonly have, who moſt eſteem them. With reaſon did Chriſt our Redeemer call riches thorns, becauſe they enſnare and wound us with danger, loſſes, unquietneſs, and fears. Wherefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of the rich man,<note place="margin">Job. <hi>20.</hi> Greg. l. <hi>15.</hi> Mor. c. <hi>12.</hi>

                        <pb n="330" facs="tcp:51068:174"/>explicates in theſe words. <q>He is firſt troubled with a wearineſs in ſeeking how to compaſs (ſometimes by flattery, ſometimes by terrours) what his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs deſires: and having obtained it, the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of keeping it is no leſs vexatious. He fears Theeves, and is afrighted with the power of great ones, leſt they ſhould by violence take his wealth from him; and if he meet one in want, preſently ſuſpects he may rob him; and thoſe very things which he hath gathered together, he fears leſt their own nature may conſume them. Since then the fear of all theſe things is a trouble and vexation, the miſerable wretch ſuffers in as many things as he fears.</q> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo ſayes, that the rich man muſt needs want many things, becauſe he is content with nothing, and is a ſlave of his avarice, ſtill full of fears and ſuſpicion, hated, envied, murmured at, and made the enemy of all men: whileſt the poor life, which walks the Kings high-way, ſecured and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Theeves and Enemies, is a Port free from ſtorms, a School of wiſdom, and a life of peace and quietneſs.<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>47.</hi> in Mat.</note> And in another place he ſayes thus. <q>If thou ſhalt well conſider the heart of an avaritious and covetous man, thou ſhalt finde it like a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpoiled and conſumed with moths, and ten thouſand worms, ſo corrupted and overcome with cares, that it ſeems not the heart of a man.</q> Such is not the heart of the poor, which ſhines like gold, is firm as a rock of diamonds, pleaſant as a roſe, and free from fear, theeves, cares and ſollicitudes, lives a an Angel of heaven, preſent onely to God and his ſervice, whoſe converſation is more with Angels than Men, whoſe treaſure is God, not needing of any to ſerve him, ſince he onely ſerves his Creator, whoſe ſlaves are his own thoughts and deſires, over which he abſolutely commands. What more precious than this, what more beautiful? But the little help, which humane life receives from temporal riches, cannot be
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:51068:174"/>better expreſt than by that which <hi>David</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.</note> 
                        <hi>The rich have wanted and were a hungred: but thoſe who ſeek the Lord, ſhall not be defrauded of all good.</hi> If then the abundance of wealth cannot free us from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the body, how ſhall they reſcue us in the griefs and cares of the minde?</p>
                     <p>Neither are honours more favourable unto humane life. What anguiſh of heart doth the fear of loſing them coſt us, and what ſhifts are we put to to preſerve them? great are the inconveniences which many ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſuſtain them, even to the want of neceſſary food.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.</note> For as <hi>Pharao</hi> exacted things impoſſible from the Children of Iſrael, commanding that no ſtraw ſhould be allowed them for the burning of their bricks, and yet that the ſame Tax and number ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as before: The ſame tyranny is exerciſed over many by the World, which takes away the ſtock and ſubſtance, which they formerly had to ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet commands them ſtill to maintain the ſame pomp and equipage, which they did when they enjoy'd it; ſo that many are forced by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (as they term it) to maintain a Coach and Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, which they need not, when they have ſcarcely wherewith to feed their hungry bellies. In others what melancholly and ſadneſs is ſometimes cauſed by a vain ſuſpicion, that ſome have thought or ſpoken ill of them? ſo many are the miſchiefs and vexations, which this counterfeit good draws along with it, that many have given thanks to God, that he hath taken this burthen of honour from them, that ſo they might live in greater quiet and repoſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes, That if a man were offered two wayes, whereof the one led to Honour, and the other to Death, he ſhould chooſe the latter. <hi>Lucian</hi> deſiring to expreſs it more fully, feigns that one of the Gods refuſed his Deity, becauſe he would not be troubled with being alwayes honoured.

                     <p>The exceſs alſo of pleaſures what miſeries doth it heap upon us? what infirmities doth it engender in our bodies? what torments and reſentments in our conſciences? for as he, who wanders out of his way without reflecting on it, is by the briers, buſhes, pits, and unevenneſs of the ground put in minde that he hath loſt himſelf, which, although he be otherwiſe well accommodated, yet troubles and afflicts him: So the wayes and paths of a delicious man cry out unto him, that he goes aſtray, and muſt therefore cauſe a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and a ſadneſs in his heart.<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>10.</hi> in Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel.</note> Well ſaid St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> that he was a fool, who looked for joy and peace in the delights of the world; for thoſe are the effects of the Holy Ghoſt and companions of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which are farre removed from the cares and vanities of the earth. Beſides all our pleaſures are ſo intermixt with trouble and importunities, that it is the greateſt pleaſure to want them. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who was a great ſtudier of pleaſures,<note place="margin">Hieron. contra Jovinian.</note> did, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> writes, enrich all his books with ſentences of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſobriety; and he hath ſcarce a leaf which is not filled with pot-herbs, fruits, roots, and other mean food of ſmall trouble: the ſollicitude in ſetting forth of banquets being greater than the delight we receive in their abuſe. <hi>Diogenes</hi> in the ſame manner, and other Philoſophers, deſpiſed pleaſures as prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the commodities of life, paſſing for that cauſe their lives in great poverty. <hi>Crates</hi> flung all his goods into the Sea: and <hi>Zeno</hi> was glad his were drowned with a Tempeſt. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> would not admit the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Calicias;</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was content with one Coat, living in poverty and temperance, to the end he might live with content and honour, and free from neceſſities, which are often greater amongſt the rich than the poor.

Wherefore the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of thoſe who are called Rich, and of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51068:175"/>the Poor of the Goſpel, ſayes, thoſe are as it were rich, and enjoy nothing, and theſe are as it were poor, and poſſeſs all things. For which reaſon St. <hi>Gregory</hi> noted, that our Saviour Chriſt called not the Riches of the world abſolutely Riches, but falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Riches.

                     <p>It is more to be feared when the goods of this life cauſe the evils of the other, and that they not onely rob us of the content of the preſent, but occaſion the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the future, and after one hell in this life throw us down into another after death. Well ſaid St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, that it was a difficult thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy both the goods preſent and to come, to paſſe from temporal pleaſures to eternal, and to be great both here and there; for he who places his whole felicity in pamparing himſelf here, will be tormented here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: and he who is unjuſtly flattered and honoured here, ſhall be juſtly ſcornd and deſpiſed there. This was well declared by St. <hi>Vincent Ferrer</hi> in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Faulcon and the Hen. The Hen whileſt ſhe lives ſeeks her food in the dirt and dunghils, and at beſt feeds now and then upon ſome bran or light corn; The Faulcon to the contrary is cheriſhed, carried upon his Maſters fiſt, and fed with the brains of Birds and Partridges: but after death they change their conditions; for the Faulcon is flung upon the dunghil, and the Hen ſerved to the table of Kings. As <hi>Jacob</hi> changed his hands, placing his right hand upon his Grandchild who ſtood upon his left ſide, and his left hand upon him who ſtood upon the right, preferring the younger before the elder; ſo God uſes to change his hands after death, and preferre the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51068:176"/>younger, who are the poor and deſpiſed in this life. For this Chriſt our Redeemer pronounces ſo many Woes againſt the rich of this world. Woe be unto you rich, who rejoyce in this world: yee ſhall weep in the next; Woe be unto you who are now filled: you ſhall hunger hereafter; Woe be unto them, who have their heaven here; it is to be feared a hell will ſucceed it. Let us tremble at what was ſpoken unto the rich glutton; Thou didſt receive pleaſure in this life: and for this eternal evils ſucceeded thee after death, changing hands with poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who received evils in this life, and after death enjoyed the pleaſures of the other. The rich man, who wanted not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of precious wines in this life, wanted a drop of water to cool his tongue in the next; And <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who here wanted the crums of bread that fell from his table, was feaſted with the Supper of eternal happineſs. The Prophet <hi>Jeremias</hi> writes that <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardan</hi> carried a way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rich Captives unto <hi>Babylon,</hi>

                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.</note> and left the poor in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> becauſe the Devil carries away the ſlayes and lovers of riches unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is the confuſion of hell, and leaves the poor in ſpirit in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the viſion of peace, that they may there enjoy the clear ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>The felicity of temporal goods blots out of our memories the greatneſs of the eternal; it makes us forget God, and the happineſs of the other life; it blindes thoſe who poſſeſſe them, buſies them wholly in things of the Earth, and gives them that means and opportunities for vices, which the poor have not, who either work or ſerve their Maſters, or pray.

The truth is, that the holy Scripture is full of Contumelies againſt the rich of this world, and above all the Son of God, who uttered moſt notable and feareful expreſſions againſt thoſe who abound in temporal goods; and therefore when he taught the Beatitudes, he gave the firſt of them unto the Poor: and in preaching the Woes he gave the firſt unto the Rich. And upon another occaſion ſaid, it was impoſſible for the Rich to enter into the Kingdom of heaven. And although he was willing to mitigate ſo hard a Sentence, yet he ſaid, it was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and ſo difficult, as might make the rich of the world to tremble; for he aſſure, us it is eaſier for a Camel to paſs through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven. But with God nothing is impoſſible. From all that which hath been ſaid may be gathered, how worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and hatred are all temporal goods, ſince they deceive us not onely of our content in this life, but of our felicity in the other, and even of God himſelf. What implacable hatred would a faithful and honeſt Spouſe conceive againſt that Traitor, who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the ſhape and habit of her Husband ſhould vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate her Chaſtity? how would ſhe abhorre him, when ſhe knew the injury he had done her in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that importance? In the ſame manner are we betrayed by temporal felicity, who appearing unto its in the likeneſs of the true happineſs, makes our hearts to adulterate with it, and leave our lawful
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:51068:177"/>Spouſe and true good indeed, which is God. For certainly there is no perfect felicity but in his ſervice, and complyance with his holy will in this life, that we may enjoy him eternally in the next; and therefore temporal goods, which by their deceit cozen us, and make us loſe the eternal, ought not to be loved and followed, but hated as a thouſand deaths.</p>

                     <q>If it were requiſite every day to ſuffer torments, or to remain in hell it ſelf for ſome long time, to the end we might behold Chriſt in his glory, and enjoy the company of Saints, were it much to ſuffer what is grievous and painful upon earth, that we might be partakers of ſo great a happineſs?</q> which ſpeech of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is not to be taken as an exaggeration; as neither that, which is attributed to St. <hi>Jerome:</hi>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:51068:178"/>That it is a wonder that the ſtones under the feet of thoſe, who ſhall be damned, convert not into roſes, as an anticipated ſolace of thoſe evils which they are to ſuffer: And that to the contrary thoſe under the feet of them, who are to be ſaved, turn not into thorns to wound and chaſtiſe them for their ſins, ſince for ſo ſhort troubles they are to receive unſpeakable joyes. This greatneſs of eternal goodneſs conſiſts not onely in the eternity of their duration, but in their intention alſo, as being ſupreme and without limit in their excellency. And therefore we ought not to think much at the ſuffering of a thouſand years torments, if for them we might obtain thoſe bleſſings but for one day. Whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes; <q>Such is the beauty of righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Auguſ. de libero arb. <hi>3.</hi>

Thou haſt moved a fooliſh queſtion, replied the Spirit; for there is no expreſſing of it. But to give ſome ſatisfaction to thy deſire, I ſay, that if the beauties of all Creatures, Heavens, Earth, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Pearls, and all other things that can give any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the ſight, were all compriſed in one onely thing; if every one of the Stars yielded as much light as the Sun, and the Sun ſhined as bright as all they together, all this united ſo together would be in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the beauty of God Almighty, as a dark pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy night in reſpect of the cleareſt and brighteſt day.

But ſeeing ſhe came no more, he returned back, thinking he had left his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery the ſame morning immediately after Mattins, and that it was now about the third hour: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Convent, which was near the Wood, he found the Gate, by which he was accuſtomed to enter, to be mured up, and another opened in ſome other part, where calling upon the Porter, he was demanded Who he was, From whence he came, and What was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: He anſwered, that he was the Sacriſtan of the Church, and that having that morning gone abroad after Mattins, he found all things at his return chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The Porter demanded of him the name of the Abbot, the Prior, the Procurator. He named them all, and wondered he was neither underſtood nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enter, and why they feigned not to know thoſe Religious whom he mentioned, and deſired to be brought to the Abbot; but coming into his preſence, neither the Abbot knew him, nor he the Abbot:
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:51068:179"/>whereat the good Monk being much aſtoniſhed knew not what to ſay or do. The Abbot asked him his name, and that of his Abbot; and turning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Monaſtery, found it was more than three hundred years ſince the death of thoſe perſons which he named. Whereupon the Monk making a relation of what had happened unto him concerning the Pſalm, they acknowledged him, and admitted him as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their profeſſion, where having received the Sacraments of the Church he with much peace ended his dayes in our Lord.</p>
                  <p>If the pleaſure of one ſenſe did ſo raviſh the Soul of this Servant of God, what ſhall it be, when not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hearing, but the light, ſmell, taſte, the whole body and ſoul ſhall be drowned in joyes proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſenſes of the one, and power of the other?

For as <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> who raigned from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> over 170 Provinces, made a great Feaſt for all his Princes, which laſted 181 dayes: So ſhall this King of Heaven and Earth make his great Supper of glory, which ſhall laſt for all eternity, for the ſetting forth of his Majeſty, and for the honour and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his Servants: where the joyes ſhall be ſuch, as neither the eye hath ſeen, nor the ear hath heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man.

The goods are imperfect, and mingled with many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and the evils ſhort, and mingled with ſome good.

                     <p>Eternal glory therefore is great, both in reſpect of its purity, being free from any ill, and in reſpect of its perfection, being highly and excellently good. <hi>David</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">

                        </note> Our famous Mathematician <hi>Chriſtopher Clavius</hi> ſayes, that from the Sphere of the Moon, which is the loweſt Heaven, unto the Earth are one hundred and twenty thouſand ſix hundred and thirty miles: and from the Heaven of the Sun four millions thirty thouſand nine hundred and twenty three miles: and from the Firmament or eighth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one hundred ſixty one millions eight hundred fourſcore and four thouſand nine hundred and fourty three miles. Here <hi>Plato</hi> wills the Mathematicians to ceaſe their enquiry; for from hence there is no rule of meaſuring further; but without all doubt it is
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:51068:180"/>much farther from thence to the Empyrial Heaven. For the onely thickneſs of the Starry Sphere is ſaid to contain as much as the whole ſpace betwixt that and the Earth: In ſo much as if a Milſtone were thrown from the higheſt of the Firmament, and ſhould every hour fall two hundred miles, it would be 90 years before it arrived at the Earth. The Mathematicians alſo and ſome learned Interpreters of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirm that the diſtance from the Earth unto the higheſt of the Firmament is leſs than that from thence to the loweſt of the Empyrial Heaven; and therefore conclude, if one ſhould live two thouſand years, and every day ſhould travel a hundred miles, he ſhould not in all that time reach the loweſt of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if after that he ſhould alſo travel other two thouſand years, he ſhould not reach the higheſt of it; and from thence four thouſand years before he arrived at the loweſt of the Empyrial Heaven.

But his ſickneſs by continuance grew ſo grievous and tedious unto him, as he often with great earneſtneſs recommended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God, and beſought him to deliver him from the priſon of his body. Whereupon an Angel appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him with this choice, either to continue two years ſick in that manner he was, and then to goe ſtraight to Heaven, or to die inſtantly, and remain three dayes in Purgatory. He was not long in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but preſently choſe the latter: and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died; but had not been an hour in thoſe pains,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51068:182"/>when the ſame Angel appeared unto him again, and after ſome encouragement and conſolation demanded if he knew him; he anſwered, No. I am, ſaid he, the Angel who brought thee that choice from Heaven, either to come hither, or to remain in thy infirmity for two years: To whom the afflicted ſoul replied; It is impoſſible thou ſhouldeſt be the Angel of the Lord: for good Angels cannot lie; and that Angel told me, I ſhould remain in this place but three dayes; and it is now ſo many years, that I have ſuffered thoſe moſt bitter torments, and can yet ſee no end of my miſery. Know then, ſaid the Angel, that it is not yet an hour, ſince thou left thy body, and the reſt of the three dayes yet remain for thee to ſuffer; To whom the Soul replied, Pray unto the Lord for me, that he look not upon my ignorance in making ſo fooliſh a choice, but that out of his Divine mercy he will give me leave to return once more unto life, and I will not onely patiently ſuffer thoſe two years, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as it ſhall pleaſe him to impoſe upon me. His Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was granted, and being reſtored unto life, his experience of Purgatory made all the pains of his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſeem light unto him; in ſo much as he endured them not onely with patience but joy.

An Angel appeared unto him, and gave him his choice either of ſuffering one day in Purgatory, or remaining a whole year longer ſick as he was. He made choice to die preſently; and had ſcarce been one hour in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; when he began to complain of the Angel, for having cozened him. The Angel appeared unto him again, certifying him, that his body was not yet buried becauſe there was one onely hour paſt ſince his death. He gave him his choice the ſecond time. His Soul
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:51068:182"/>was preſently reunited to the body, and he roſe out of his Bed to the great aſtoniſhment of all. If this then paſs in Purgatory, it will not be leſs in hell; and if an hour ſeem a year, which contains above eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hours, an eternity in hell will appear eleven thouſand eternities. O how dearly bought are the ſhort pleaſures of the ſenſes, which are paid for with ſo long and ſo innumerable torments! For if pain ſhould laſt no longer than the pleaſure that deſerved it, it would ſeem to thoſe, who are to feel it, ten thouſand times longer. What will it do being eternal?

He himſelf ſayes, That his Father will honour them in Heaven; and <hi>David</hi> ſings; <hi>Thou haſt crowned him with glory and honour;</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus</hi> (as it is applied by the Church) <hi>A Crown of Gold upon his head graven with the ſeal of holineſs, and the glory of honour.</hi> Beſides, all the tribute, which thoſe who ſerve God are able to pay him, is onely to laud and honour him. His eternal joy, happineſs, and all his intrinſecal perfections are ſo excellent, that they can receive no addition; onely this glory and honour, as they are an exteriour good, are capable of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And this is that which he receives from the Saints who ſerve him: With which God is ſo pleaſed, that he pays them again in the ſame money, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thoſe who honoured him; and this honour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at that height, that Chriſt himſelf expreſſes it in theſe words;<note place="margin">

                     <q>How great ſhall be that glory, when a juſt Soul ſhall in the preſence of an infinite number of Angels ſit in the ſame Throne with Chriſt, and ſhall by the juſt Sentence of God be praiſed for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror over the World, and the inviſible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell! and how ſhall that Soul rejoyce, when it ſhall ſee it ſelf, being freed from all danger and troubles; to triumph over all its enemies! What can it deſire more than to be partaker of all thoſe divine goods, and even to accompany Chriſt in the ſame Throne? O how chearfully do they combat upon Earth: O how eaſily do they bear all afflictions for Chriſt, who with a lively faith and certain hope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:51068:183"/>ſo ſublime honours!</q> Certainly with much reaſon may the happineſs of Saints be called by the name of Glory, ſince the honour which they receive is ſo tranſcendent. What an honour ſhall that be, when the Juſt in the other liſe ſhall receive no leſs a recompence of his holineſs than God himſelf? The nature of honour is to be a reward of vertue: and by how much greater the reward is, which a powerful King beſtows upon ſome valorous Captain, by ſo much greater is the honour which he confers upon him. What honour ſhall it then be, when God ſhall give unto thoſe who have ſerved him, not onely to tread upon the Starres, to inhabit the Palaces of Heaven, to be Lords of the World, but tranſcending all that is created, and finding amongſt his whole riches nothing ſufficient to reward them, ſhall give them his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite eſſence to enjoy, not for a day, but to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? The higheſt honour which the <hi>Romans</hi> beſtowed upon their greateſt Captains, was to grant them a day of triumph, and in that permiſſion to wear a Crown of graſs or leaves, which withered the day following. O moſt honoured vertue of Chriſtians, whole triumph ſhall be eternal, and whoſe never fading Crown is God himſelf! O moſt happy Diadem of the Juſt, O moſt precious Garland of the Saints, which is of as great worth and value, as is God! <hi>Sapores</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was moſt ambitious of honour, and would therefore be called the Brother of the Sun and Moon, and Friend to the Planets. This vain Prince erected a moſt glorious Throne, which he placed on high, and thereon fat in great Majeſty, having under his feet a certain Globe of glaſs, whereon were artificially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the motions of the Sun, the Moon and Stars: and to ſit crowned above this phantaſtical Heaven he eſteemed as a great honour. What ſhall be then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the juſt, who truly and really ſhall ſit above the Sun, the Moon, and Firmament, crowned by the hand of God himſelf? If the applauſe of men and the good
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51068:184"/>opinion which they have from others be eſteemed an honour, what ſhall be the applauſe of Heaven, and the good opinion not onely of Saints and Angels, but of God himſelf, whoſe judgements cannot erre? <hi>David</hi> took it for a great honour, that the Daughter of his King was judged as a reward of his valour. God ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes this; and honours ſo much the ſervices of his Elect, that he pays their merits with no leſs a reward than himſelf. O happy labour of the victorious, and glorious combat of the juſt againſt the vices and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the World, whoſe victory deſerves ſo ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable a Crown! <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> reports that there were in <hi>Perſia</hi> three Mountains; He, who came to the firſt, heard as it were a farre off the noiſe and voice of them who were fighting; he who attained at the ſecond, heard perfectly the cries and clamours of Souldiers engaged in the fury of a Battail; but he who attained unto the third heard nothing but the joyful acclamations of a victory. This happens really with the juſt, who are likewiſe to paſs three myſtical Mountains, which are Reaſon, Grace, and Glory. He who arrives at the knowledge of Reaſon, gives an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm unto Vice, which he combats and overcomes by Grace, and in Glory celebrates his victory with the joy and applauſe of all the Inhabitants of heaven, and is crowned as a Conquerour with ſuch a Crown, as we have already ſpoken of.</p>

                     <p>Beſides this, he who is moſt known, and is praiſed and celebrated for good and vertuous by the greateſt multitude, is eſteemed the moſt glorious and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon. But all this World is a ſolitude in reſpect of the Citizens of Heaven, where innumerable Angels approve and praiſe the vertuous actions of the Saints; and they likewiſe are nothing, and all creatures, Men and Angels, but as a ſolitary Wilderneſs in reſpect of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51068:184"/>the Creator. What compariſon betwixt that honour which may be given by ſome particular Kingdom, or by all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that which ſhall be heaped upon the juſt by all the bleſſed Men and Angels: nay even by the damned and Devils in the Day of Judgement? What is the approbation of a created underſtanding in reſpect of the Divine? What man ſo glorious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, whoſe worth and valour hath been known to all? Thoſe who were born before him could not know him; no more ſhall many of thoſe who are to follow him. But the Predeſtinate in heaven ſhall be known by all paſt and to come, by all the Angels and by the King of Men and Angels. Humane fame is founded upon the applauſe of mortal men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides being leſs than Angels, may be deceived, may lie, and are moſt part of them ſinners and wicked. How farre then muſt that honour exceed it, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Juſt by the holy Angels, and by thoſe bleſſed and pure Souls, who cannot be deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor will deceive us? If we eſteem it more to be honoured by the Kings of the Earth, by the Great men of the World, and by the Learned in Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than by the barbarous and ignorant Peaſants of ſome poor Village, how ought we then to value the honou, rwhich ſhall be beſtowed upon us by the Saints in Heaven, who are the Kings and Grandees of the Court of God, and are all repleniſhed with moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and divine wiſdom? All the honour of men is ridiculous, and his ambition no wiſer who ſeeks it, then, as St. <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſayes, if one worm ſhould deſire to be honoured by another.<note place="margin">Lib. de Sim. c. <hi>65.</hi>

In the like manner St. <hi>James Interciſus,</hi> who was hacked in pieces member by member for the faith of Chriſt. Even the Confeſſors in thoſe Senſes, which they have mortified for Chriſt, ſhall have a particular Enamel of light. St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt was ſhewed to St. <hi>Matilde,</hi> with a particular ſplendour and glory in his eyes, for not daring to lift them up to look upon our Bleſſed Lady, when he lived with her, for the great eſteem and reverence he bore unto her. There is no kind of honour, which ſhall not then be given to the heroical acts of vertue performed by the Saints in this life, which ſhall be to be read in the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the predeſtinate; ſo as there ſhall be no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Hiſtories, Annals, or Statues, to make known or eternize their memories, as here in worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, which being ſhort, tranſitory, and of ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance have need of ſomething to preſerve them in the memory of men.

But in Heaven there is no need of this artifice; becauſe thoſe who are there honoured are immortal, and ſhall have in themſelves ſome character engraved as an evident and clear teſtimony of their noble Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories and Atchievements. The honour of the Juſt in Heaven depends not, like that of the Earth, upon accidents and reports, nor is expoſed to dangers, or meaſured by the diſcourſe of others, but in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its own glory and dignity.<note place="margin">Cuiac. ad tit. de dignit.</note> The dignities in the <hi>Roma</hi> Empire, as may be gathered from the Civil Law, were four, expreſſed by theſe four Titles, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiſſimus, Clariffimus, Spectabilis, &amp; Illuſtris,</hi> moſt Perfect, moſt Clear, Specious, and Illuſtrious. Theſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51068:187"/>Honours were onely in name and reputation, not in ſubſtance and truth. For He was often called moſt perfect, who was indiſcreet, fooliſh, paſſionate, and imperfect: He moſt clear, who had neither clearneſs nor ſerenitity of underſtanding, but was infected with dark and obſcure vices. Thoſe ſpecious and beautiful, from whom a man would flye twenty leagues rather than behold them; and thoſe illuſtrious, who were enveloped in the darkneſs of vice and ignorance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt light of vertue. That we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee the difference betwixt the honours of Heaven, and thoſe of the Earth, which are as farre diſtant from one another, as truth from falſehood, we muſt know that in Heaven the Bleſſed are not onely called moſt Perfect, but really are ſo both in ſoul and body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt imperfection or defect: are not onely called moſt Clear, but are ſo, each one being adorned with that gift of brightneſs, that they ſhall caſt out beams more clear than the Sun; and if the Sun be the moſt bright thing in nature, what ſhall they be, who ſeaventimes out-ſhine it? Nor ſhall they be onely ſaid to be <hi>ſpectabilis</hi> or ſpecious, and worthy to be looked upon, but their beauty and comelineſs ſhall be ſuch, as ſhall not onely draw the eyes of all to behold them, but ſhall ſtirre up their affections to love and admire them. In the like manner they ſhall not be titularly, but really Illuſtrious: for every one with his own light ſhall be ſufficient to illuſtrate and enlighten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Worlds.

                     <p>Certainly greater honour cannot be imagined than that of the Predeſtinate. For if we look upon him, who honours, It is God; If with what: With no leſs joy than his own Divinity, and other moſt ſublime gifts; If before whom: Before the whole Theater of Heaven now, and in the Day of Judgement before Heaven, Earth, Angels, Men and Devils; If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: For all eternity; If the titles, which he gives them, it is the truth and ſubſtance of the things, not the empty word and vain name. By all this may appear the cauſe, why eternal happineſs, being a maſs and an aſſembly of all goods imaginable, yet is called (by way of excellence) by the name of Glory; becauſe that although it contain all pleaſures, contents, joyes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and what can be defired, yet it ſeems the Glory and honour, which God beſtows upon the Juſt, exceeds all the other.

                  <p>THe Riches in Heaven are no leſs than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, though thoſe, as hath been ſaid, are ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. There can be no greater riches than to want nothing which is good, nor to need any thing which can be deſired; and in that bleſſed life no good ſhall fall, nor no deſire be unſatisfied. And if, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſay, he is not rich who poſſeſſeth much, but he who deſires nothing, There being in Heaven no deſire unaccompliſhed, there muſt needs be great rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

Since then in the Celeſtial Kingdom there is neceſſity of nothing, moſt rich is he who enters into it. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe Divine Riches Chriſt our Saviour when he ſpeaks in his Parables of the Kingdom of Heaven, doth often expreſs it under Names and Enigma's of things that are rich; ſometimes calling it the Hidden Treaſure, and ſometimes the Precious Pearl, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times the Loſt Drachma. For if Divine happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſt in the eternal poſſeſſion of God, what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be compared with his who enjoyes him, and what inheritance to that of the Kingdom of Heaven? What Jewel more precious than the Divinity, and what Gold more pure than the Creator of Gold and all things precious, who gives himſelf for a Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Riches unto the Saints, to the end they ſhould abhorre thoſe Riches which are temporal, if by them the eternal are endangered? Let not therefore thoſe who are to die to morrow afflict themſelves for that which may periſh ſooner than they. Let them not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51068:189"/>toyl to enjoy that which they are ſhortly to leave; nor let them with more fervour pray for thoſe things which are tranſitory, than thoſe which are eternal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Creature before the Creator, not ſeeking God for what he is, but for what he gives.

                     <q>God will be ſerved gratis, will be beloved without intereſt, that is, purely for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not for any thing without himſelf; and therefore he who in invokes God to make him rich, does not invoke God, but that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhould come unto him; for what is invocation but calling ſomething unto him? wherefore when thou ſhalt ſay; My God give me riches, thou doſt not deſire that God but riches ſhould come unto thee; for if thou hadſt invoked God, he would have come unto thee, and been thy riches; but thou deſiredſt to have thy Coffers full, and thy heart emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and God fills not Cheſts but breaſts.</q>

                     <p>Beſides the poſſeſſion of God, it imports us much to frame a conception of this Kingdom of Heaven, which is that of the Juſt, where they ſhall reign with Chriſt eternally, whoſe riches muſt needs be immenſe, ſince they are to be Kings of ſo great and ample a Kingdom. The place then which the Bleſſed are to inhabit is called ſhe Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe it is a moſt large Region, and much greater than can perhaps fall under the capacity of our underſtanding. And if the Earth compared with Heaven be but a point, and yet contain ſo many Kingdoms, what ſhall that be which is but one Kingdom, and yet extended over the whole Heavens? How poor and narrow a heart muſt that Chriſtian have, who confines his love to things preſent, ſweating and toyling for a ſmall part of the goods of this World, which it ſelf is ſo little? why does he content himſelf with ſome poor
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:51068:189"/>patch of the Earth, when he may be Lord of the whole Heavens? Although this Kingdom of God be ſo great and ſpacious, yet it is not diſpeopled, but as full of Inhabitants of all Nations and conditions, as if it were a City or ſome particular Houſe. There (as the Apoſtle ſaid) are many thouſands of Angels, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Juſt, even as many as have died ſince <hi>Abel:</hi> and thither alſo ſhall repair all who are to die unto the end of the World, and after judgement ſhall there remain for ever inveſted in their glorious bodies. There ſhall inhabit the Angelical Spirits diſtinguiſhed with great decency into their Nine Orders, unto whom ſhall correſpond Nine others of the Saints, Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Paſtors &amp; Doctors, Prieſts and Levites, Monks and Hermits, Virgins and other holy Women. This populous City ſhall not be inhabited with mean and baſe People, but with Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſo noble, rich, juſt, and diſcreet, that all of them ſhall be moſt holy and wiſe Kings. How happy ſhall it be to live with ſuch perſons? The Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> onely to ſee <hi>Salomon</hi> came from the end of the Earth; and to ſee <hi>Titus Livius</hi> Nations and Provinces far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant came to <hi>Rome.</hi> To behold a King iſſue out of his Palace all the People flock together. What ſhall it then be not onely to ſee, but to live and raign with ſo many Angels, and converſe with ſo many eminent and holy Men? If onely to ſee St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert men left their Houſes and Countries, what joy ſhall it be to diſcourſe and converſe with ſo many Saints in Heaven? If there ſhould now deſcend from thence one of the Prophets or Apoſtles, with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and admiration would every one ſtrive to ſee and hear him? In the other World we ſhall hear and ſee them all. St. <hi>Romane</hi> at the ſight of one Angel when he was a Gentile left the world and his life to become a Chriſtian. How admirable ſhall it then be to ſee thouſand of thouſands in all their beauty and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo many glorious bodies of Saints in all their
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:51068:190"/>luſtre? If one Sun be ſufficient to clear up the whole World here below, what joy ſhall it be to behold thoſe innumerable Sum in that Region of light?</p>
                     <p>From this multitude of Inhabitants, the place of glory is not only called the Kingdom of Heaven, but the City of God. It is called a Kingdom for its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe greatneſs, and a City for its great beauty and population. It is not like other Kingdoms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which contain huge Deſerts, inacceſſible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and thick Woods: nor is it devided into many Cities and Villages diſtant one from another; but this Kingdom of God, although a moſt ſpacious Region, is all one beautiful City. Who would not wonder if all <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> were but one City, and that as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who found it of Brick, and left it of Marble? What a ſight were that of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> if it were all a <hi>Babylon;</hi> or that of <hi>Syria,</hi> if all a <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> What ſhall then be the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial City of Saints, whoſe greatneſs poſſeſſes the whole Heavens: and is as the holy Scripture deſcribes it (to exaggerate the riches of the Saints) all of Gold and precious Stones? The Gates pf this City were, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes, one entire Pearl, and the foundations of the Walls Jaſper, Saphire, Calcedon, Emerald, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz, Jacinth, Amethiſt, and other moſt precious Stones; The Streets of fine Gold, ſo pure, as it ſeemed Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, joyning in one ſubſtance the firmneſs of Gold and tranſparency of Chryftal, and the beauty both of one and the other.</p>
                     <p>If all <hi>Rome</hi> were of Saphire, how would it amaze the world? how marvelous then will the holy City be, which though extended over ſo many millions of leagues, is all of Gold, Pearl, and precious Stones, or, to ſay better, of a matter of farre more value, and peopled with ſuch a multitude of beautiful Citizens, as are as farre above any imaginable number, as the capacity of the City is above any imaginable meaſure? Some famous Mathematicians ſay of die Empyrial
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51068:190"/>Heaven, that it is ſo great, that if God ſhould allow unto every one of the bleſſed a greater ſpace than the whole Earth, yet there would remain as much more to give unto others; and that the capaciouſneſs of this Heaven is ſo great, that it contains more than ten thouſand and fourteen millions of miles. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will it be to ſee a City ſo great of ſo precious matter? The Divines confeſs the capaciouſneſs of this Heaven to be immenſe, but are more willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it, than bold to meaſure it.<note place="margin">Joan. Gailer in ſuo Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grino.</note> Howſoever there wants not one, who ſayes, that if God ſhould make each grain of ſand upon the Sea-ſhore as big as the whole Earth, they would not fill the Concave of the Empyrial Heaven;) and yet this Holy City poſſeſſeth all that ſpace, and is all compoſed of matter far more beautiful and precious, than Gold, Pearl, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. For certain our thoughts cannot conceive ſo great riches and wonders; for which we ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all the pains and neceſſities of this World. St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> being afflicted with a grievous pain of his eyes, in ſo much as he could neither ſleep,<note place="margin">Chron. Frat. Min. p. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>60.</hi>
                        </note> nor take any reſt, and at the ſame time moleſted by the Devil, who filled his Cell with Rats, which with their Careers and noiſe added much unto his pain, with great patience gave thanks unto the Lord that he had ſo gently chaſtized him, ſaying, My Lord Jeſus Chriſt I deſerve greater puniſhment; but thou like a good Shepherd ſuffer me not to ſtray from thee. Being in this meditation he heard a voice, which ſaid unto him: <hi>Francis,</hi> if all the Earth were of Gold, and all the Rivers of Balſame, and all the Rocks of precious Stones, wouldeſt thou not ſay that this were a great treaſure? Know that a treaſure, which exceeds Gold as farre as Gold does Dirt, Balſam Water, or Precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones Pibbles, remains as a reward for thy infirmity, if thou be content and bear it with patience. Rejoyce <hi>Francis;</hi> for this treaſure is Celeſtial glory, which is gained by tribulations. Certainly we have reaſon to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:51068:191"/>ſuffer here all pains and poverty whatſoever, ſince we are to receive in glory ſo much the greater riches. Wherefore we ought to lift up our ſouls, and wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts from the frail felicity of theſe temporal goods of the Earth, to ſay with <hi>David, Glorious things are ſaid of thee City of God.</hi> So did <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring <hi>Rome</hi> when it was yet in its luſtre, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs, beauty, and marvelous Architecture of it, ſaid with admiration; <hi>O Celeſtial Jeruſalem, how beautiful muſt thou be, if Terreſtrial Rome be ſuch!</hi> A ſhadow of this was ſhewed unto St. <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory is written by St. <hi>John Damaſcen.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In vita Joſaph. &amp; Barl.</note> St: <hi>Joſaphat</hi> being in profound prayer proſtrate upon the earth was overtaken with a ſweet ſleep, in which he ſaw two men of grave demeanour, who carried him through many unknown Countries unto a Field full of flowers and plants of rare beauty, laden with fruit never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen. The leaves of the trees moved with a ſoft and gentle wind yielded a pleaſant ſound, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth a moſt ſweet odour; there were placed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seats of Gold and precious Stones, which ſhined with a new kind of brightneſs; and a little Brook of Chryſtal water refreſhed the air, and pleaſed the ſight with a moſt agreable variety. From thence he was brought into a moſt beautiful City, whoſe Walls were of tranſparent Gold, the Towers and Battlements were of Stones of ineſtimable value, the Streets and places ſhone with Celeſtial beams of light: And there paſſed up and down bright Armies of Angels and Seraphins, chanting ſuch ſongs as were never heard by mortal ears. Amongſt other he heard a voice, which ſaid, This is the repoſe of the Juſt, this the joy of thoſe who have given a good account of their lives unto God. But all this is no more than a dream and a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in compariſon of the truth, greatneſs, and riches of that Celeſtial Court. In regard that all the Bleſſed together with Chriſt are to raign in this moſt rich City and, Kingdom, how great ſhall the riches be? who was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51068:191"/>ever ſo rich as to have at the entrance of his Houſe a maſſie large piece of Gold two or three yards long? What riches will thoſe be of Heaven? becauſe all the Kingdom of Heaven is to be of pure Gold, all the Streets, and all the Houſes of that Holy City; and not only Gold, but more than Gold. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make us on one part underſtand the riches of this Kingdom of God, and on the other part to know that they are of a higher and more excellent nature than thoſe of the Earth, expreſſes them with the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the riches of this World, as Gold, Pearl and precious Stones, becauſe by theſe names we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things of great wealth and value: but withall ſets them forth for ſuch as are not to be found upon earth; ſo as when it ſpeaks of Pearls, it ſayes, they were ſo great as they ſerved for the Gates of a City: when it ſpeaks of Emeralds and Topaz's, it makes them to ſuffice for the foundatian of high Walls and Turrets; when of Gold, it makes it tranſparent as (Glaſs or Chryſtal. All this is to ſignifie that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there are not onely greater riches, but of a more ſublime and high quality than ours upon Earth. And with reaſon is that Holy City called the Kingdom of Heaven, to let us know, that the ſame advantage, that Heaven hath above Earth, the ſame have Celeſtial ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, riches, and joyes above thoſe which are here below. If the whole Earth is no more than a point in reſpect of the Heavens, what can thoſe ſhort and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible riches be in reſpect of the eternal?</p>

                     <p>Of thoſe incomparable riches the Bleſſed are not onely to be Lords but Kings, as appears in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scripture. Neither is the Celeſtial Treaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or this Kingdom of Heaven leſs or poorer by having ſo many Lords and Kings. It is not like the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms on Earthy; which permit but one King at once,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:51068:192"/>and if divided become of leſs power and Majeſty; but is of ſuch condition, that it is wholly poſſeſſed by all in general, and by each one in particular, like the Sun which warms all and every one, and not one leſs, becauſe it warms many. The effects of riches are much greater and more noble in Heaven, than they can be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Wealth may ſerve us here to maintain our power, honours, and delights: but all the Gold in the world cannot free us from weakneſs, infamy, and pain. The power of a rich King can reach no further than to Command his Vaſſals; and thoſe who diſobey him he may either chaſtiſe with impriſonment or death, and is therefore fear'd and reſpected by them. But all this power is invalid without the aſſiſtance of his Subjects. For what will it avail a Prince to command ſuch a City to be defended, if the Souldiers within have a minde to deliver it? And therefore a certain Jeſter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain</hi> demanded of him, If all ſhould ſay No unto what your Majeſty commands, what was to be done? giving him to underſtand that his power depends upon others. The power of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch depends not onely upon the will of his Subjects, but the Walls of his Fortreſſes, Arms, Inſtruments of Warre, and many other things; ſo as the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend onely upon one man, which is the Prince: but the Prince upon many men and matters, in ſo much as many rich Kings have been ſeen without power, as <hi>Craeſus, Andronicus,</hi> and others, who were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves with all their riches from their own Vaſſals. Witneſs <hi>Domitian, Commodus, Heliogabolus</hi> and <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> But the power of the Bleſſed depends of no other power nor man;<note place="margin">Anſel de Simil. c. <hi>52.</hi>
                        </note> which, as St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſayes, ſhall be ſo great, as no force or reſiſtance ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. It a Saint have a mind to remove a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from one place to another, he ſhall do it with as much eaſe, as we remove our eyes from one part unto another. Neither is this a wonder. For even the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this life according to the promiſe of Chriſt have
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:51068:192"/>done it, as is written of St. <hi>Gregorius Thaumaturgus,</hi> and ſome others. And if Angels, nay Devils have this power, the Bleſſed ſhall not be denyed it. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour, the richeſt Princes can onely make their Vaſſals to adore them upon the knee, and do them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward reverence, but cannot hinder them from murmuring in their abſence, or from obſerving their actions, and interpreting them as they pleaſe. They have many flatterers, which praiſe them with their tongues, and ſcorn them in their hearts; and for the moſt part they are farre fewer, who praiſe, than deſpiſe them; for there are but few, who diſcourſe with them, but many who diſcourſe of them; and therefore few who praiſe them in preſence, and many who cenſure them in abſence. Concerning pleaſures, it is true that Princes are not content with ordinary delights, and therefore provide themſelves of magnificent Shews, coſtly Recreations, exquiſite Comedies, pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Woods for hunting, and are all cloathed ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly. But none of thoſe can make a Calenture not to afflict them, or that the pains of the head, ſtomack, or gout do not moleſt them, or that cares and fears do not break their ſleep.</p>
                     <p>No gold or money can ſecure the goods of this World, or free them from imperfections. This onely is to be had in Heaven, where their power is ſo free from weakneſs, that one onely Angel without Army, Guns, Swords,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.</note> or Lance could deſtroy at once 180000 men. with what ſpeed and facility do Saints ſuccour their devotes, who invoke them, without impediment either from the diſtance of place, or hinderance from the violence of Tyrants? How compleat then ſhall be the honor of the Bleſſed, ſince even the Devils ſhall reverence them? Nay even now many who deſpiſed them living, ſeeing the many miracles, which God hath wrought by their interceſſion, have honoured them after death. The pleaſures alſo are pure and true, without mixture of pain or grief, as we ſhall ſee in the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:51068:193"/>proper places. Beſides, it is to be conſidered that the great riches of the Saints are not like thoſe of the Kings of the Earth, drawn from the tributes impoſed upon their Vaſſals, which though juſt, yet are not free from this ill condition, that what enricheth the Prince impoveriſheth the Subject. The riches in Heaven have no ſuch blemiſhes; they are burthenſome to none; and what is given to the Servants of Chriſt who raigns in Heaven, is not taken from any.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HOnour, Profit, and Pleaſures are diſtinct goods upon Earth, and are rarely found together. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is ſeldom a companion of profit, and profit of pleaſure; And ſo the ſick man drinks his Purge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is profitable how bitter ſoever. Beſides, the pleaſures or the world are for the moſt part mixt with ſome ſhame, and oftentimes with infamy. They are coſtly and expenſive; we cannot entertain our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures without diminiſhing our wealth. It is not ſo in eternal goods, in which to be honeſt is to be profitable, and to be profitable delectable. Eternal honours are accompanied with immenſe riches, and they are both attended by pleaſures without end. All this is ſignified by the Lord, when he received the faithful Servant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory, when he ſayes, <hi>Well done good ſervant and true: becauſe thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will place thee over many; Enter into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> In theſe words he firſt honours him, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for a good and faithful Servant; then enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches him, delivering many things into his hands: and ſo admits him into the joy and pleaſure of his Lord; ſignifying by this manner of expreſſion the greatneſs
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:51068:193"/>of this joy, not ſaying, that this joy ſhould enter in to him, but that he ſhould enter into joy, and into no other but that of his Lord. So great is the joy of that Celeſtial Paradiſe, that it wholly fills and embraces the bleſſed Souls, which enter into Heaven, as into an immenſe Sea of pleaſure and delight. The joyes of the Earth enter into the hearts of thoſe who poſſeſs them, but fill them not, becauſe the capacity of mans heart is greater than they can ſatisfie. But the joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven receive the Bleſſed into themſelves, and fill and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow them in all parts. Their glory is like an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of delights, into which the Saints enter as a Sponge into the Sea, which filling its whole capacity, the water ſurrounds and compaſſes it all about.

                     <hi>and her people a joy.</hi> It is much to be noted that he ſayes not, I create a rejoycing for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor a joy in or for its people, but by a particular my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery I make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that it ſhall be all an exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and its people all a joy. He ſpeaks in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſet forth the greatneſs of his copious joy, with which that holy City, and her Inhabitants ſhall be as it were encompaſſed and overwhelmed. For as a plate of iron in the middle of a Furnace is ſo wholly inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and penetrated by fire, that it ſeems fire it ſelf, and contains the full heat of the Furnace: So a bleſſed Soul in Heaven is ſo repleniſhed with that Celeſtial joy, that it may not onely be ſaid to be joyful, but joy it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The multitude of joyes in Heaven is joyned with their greatneſs: and ſo great they are, that the very leaſt of them ſufficient to make us forget the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contents of the Earth; and ſo many they are, as that, though a thouſand times ſhorter, yet they would

                     <p>The principal joy of the Bleſſed is in the poſſeſſion of God, whom they behold clearly as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For as Honourable, Profitable, and Delectable (according to what we have already ſaid) are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Heaven, ſo the bleſſed Souls have three gifts eſſential and inſeparable from that happy ſtate, which correſpond to thoſe three kinds of bleſſings, which the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:51068:194"/>Divines call Viſion, Comprehenſion, and Fruition. The firſt conſiſts in the clear and diſtinct ſight of God, which is given to the Juſt as a reward of his merits, by which he receives an incomparable honour, ſince his works and vertues are rewarded in the preſence of all the Angels with no leſs a Crown and recompence than is God himſelf. The ſecond is the poſſeſſion which the Soul hath of God, as of his riches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. And the third is the ineffable joy which accompanies this ſight and poſſeſſion. The greatneſs of this joy no tongue can tell; and I believe that neither the Bleſſed themſelves, who have experience of it, nor the Angels of Heaven are able to declare it. Yet it will not be amiſs, if we (as much as our ignorance and rudeneſs is able to attain unto) conſider and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it. This joy hath two ſingular qualities, by which we may in ſome ſort conceive the immenſity of it. The firſt, that it is ſo vigorous and powerful, that it excludes all evil, pain, and grief. This onely is ſo great a good, that many of the Philoſophers held it for the chief felicity of man.<note place="margin">Cicero de Fin. &amp; <hi>5.</hi> Tuſcul.</note> And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> writes, that <hi>Jeronymus Rhodius,</hi> a famous Philoſopher and a great Maſter, to whom may be joyned <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Peripatetick, ſpeaking of the chief happineſs of man, taught that it conſiſted in being free from grief; It being the opinion of thoſe Philoſophers, that not to ſuffer pain or evil was the greateſt and moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good. But herein was their errour, that they judged that to be the good it ſelf, which was but an effect and conſequent of it: For ſo powerful is that love and joy, which ſprings from the clear viſion of God, that it is ſufficient to convert hell into glory; in ſo much as if to the moſt tormented Soul in hell were added all the torments of the reſt of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both Men and Devils, and that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe him but one glympſe of his knowledge, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear viſion, though in the loweſt degree, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to free him from all thoſe evils both of ſin and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:51068:195"/>pain: So that his Soul being rapt by that ineffable beauty which he beheld, would not be ſenſible of any grief at all. O how potent a joy is that, which caſt into ſuch an abyſs of torments, converts them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſolations! How mighty were that fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one ſpark would conſume the whole Ocean? There is no joy in this World ſo intenſe, which can ſuſpend the grief we ſuffer from a finger, that is in ſawing off. Griefs do more eaſily bereave us of the ſenſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than pleaſures do of pains. Yet ſuch is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſoveraign joy in Heaven, that it alone is ſufficient to drown all the griefs and torments both in Earth and Hell; and there is no pain in the World able to diminiſh the leaſt part of it.</p>
                     <p>The other ſtupendious wonder, which proceeds from the greatneſs of this joy, is the multitude of thoſe pleaſures, which as from a moſt fruitful root ſpring from it. Who would not be aſtoniſht, that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul ſhould cauſe ſo many, and ſo marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects in the bodies of the Bleſſed? So excellent is that beatifical viſion, which with ineffable joy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the ſpirit, that it burſts forth into the body with all the evident demonſtrations of beauty, luſtre, and the other gifts of glory. We ſee here that the heart is not able ſo farre to diſſemble a great joy conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that it appears not by ſome ſigne in the body; but that joy is ſo weak and feeble, that it extends no further than to expreſs ſome little chearfulneſs and mirth in the countenance. But the beatifical Viſion is ſo immenſe a joy, that it wholly changes the body, making it beautiful as an Angel, reſplendent as the Sun, immortal as a Spirit, and impaſſible as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, working great miracles and prodigies in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by the redundancie of that unſpeakable comfort, which the ſpirit feels. O if one could place before the eyes of the World the body of ſome bleſſed Saint, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endowed with the four gifts of glory, full of clearneſs, ſplendor, and beauty, caſting forth a fragrancy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:51068:195"/>more ſweet unto the ſenſes than that of Musk and Amber, that men might ſee by this ſhadow, how immenſe is that light and joy, which thus illuſtrates and beautifies the fleſh. O mortals, why do ye covet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſures with loſs of Soul and Body, and do not rather ſeek after theſe with the profit and glory of both? O how different are temporal delights from eternal! thoſe (eſpecially if they be unlawful) blemiſh and deſtroy the Soul, and weaken and corrupt the body; but theſe beautifie and embelliſh them both, conferring perfect happineſs upon the Soul, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and immortality upon the Body.</p>

                     <p>Finally all thoſe joyes of the Bleſſed both in Soul and Body, which are innumerable, have their ſourſe and original from that unſpeakable joy of the clear vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God. And how can the joy be leſs, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſuch a cauſe, who gives himſelf, being the ſweetneſs and beauty of the world, to be poſſeſſed by man, that joy being the very ſame which God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, and which ſuffices to make God himſelf bleſſed with a bleſſedneſs equal to himſelf? Wherefore not without great myſtery in thoſe words, by which our Saviour admits the faithful into Heaven, it is ſaid; <hi>Enter into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> he ſaid not ſimply into joy, but to determine the greatneſs of it, ſayes, it was his own joy, that joy, by which he himſelf becomes happy; and truly the immenſity of this joy could not better be declared. We are therefore to conſider, that there is nothing in this World, which hath not for his end ſome manner of perfection, and that thoſe things, which are capable of reaſon and knowledge, have in that perfection a particular joy and complacencie; which joy is greater or leſſer according as that end is more or leſs perfect. Since therefore the Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is infinitely greater than that of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:51068:196"/>the joy of God, which is in himſelf, (for he hath no end not perfection diſtinct from himſelf) is infinitely greater than that of all things beſides. This joy out of his infinite goodneſs and liberality he hath been pleaſed to make the holy Angels and bleſſed Souls partakers of, communicating unto the Juſt (although no wayes due unto their nature) his own proper and ſpecial felicity. And therefore the joy of Saints, which is that of the beatifical viſion, wherein conſiſts the joy and happineſs of God, muſt needs be infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, and all contents of this World in reſpect of it are bitter as alloes, gall, and wormwood.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, by how much a delectable object is more nearly and ſtraightly united to the faculty, by ſo much greater is the joy and delight which it produces. Therefore God, who is the moſt excellent and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object, being in the beatifical viſion united to the Soul with the moſt intimate union that can be in a pure creature, muſt neceſſarily cauſe a moſt inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable joy, incomparably greater than all the joyes real or imaginable, which can be produced either by the Creatures now exiſtent or poſſible. For as the Divine perfection incloſeth within it ſelf all the perfections of things created, poſſible, and imaginable, ſo the joy, which it cauſes in the Souls of the Bleſſed, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater than all other joyes, which either have, or can be cauſed by the Creature. If the <hi>Greeks</hi> warred ten years and loſt ſo much blood for the beauty of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> And if it ſeemed a ſmall thing unto <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſerve fourteen years a Slave for that of <hi>Rachel,</hi> what trouble can ſeem great unto us to enjoy God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whoſe beauty all which the World affords is but deformity? <hi>Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi> were moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and with their very ſight drew love and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their beholders. But it looking upon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon,</hi> another ten times more lovely ſhould appear, we ſhould quickly leave to gaze upon <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and fix our eyes upon the other: and if a third ſhould come
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:51068:196"/>a hundred times more graceful than the ſecond, we ſhould ſerve the ſecond in the ſame manner, and our eyes and delight would ſtill follow him, who was the moſt agreeable. God being then infinitely more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than we can either ſee or think, and although he ſhould create ſome other Creature ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more beautiful than theſe we know, yet that, and one, another million of times exceeding it, would both fall infinitely ſhort of God himſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that beauty not being alone, but accompanied with perfections without limit, with an infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, omnipotence, holineſs, liberality, bounty, and all that can be imagined good, beautiful, and perfect, which muſt neceſſarily force the hearts of thoſe who ſee him (although before his enemies) to love and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him. Which is an other proof of the joy which ſprings from the beatifical viſion, in regard it works ſo powerfully upon the will of him that enjoyes it, that it compels it by an abſolute neceſſity to a moſt intenſe love, although it had before deteſted it; becauſe the joy muſt equalize the love which it cauſed. It there were in the World a Man as wiſe as an Angel, we ſhould all deſire to ſee him, as the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> did <hi>Salmon;</hi> but if to this wiſdom were joyned the ſtrength of <hi>Hercules</hi> or <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the victories of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> the affability and curteſie of <hi>David,</hi> the friedlineſs of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the liberality of the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> and to all this the beauty and comelineſs of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> who would not love and deſire to live and converſe with this admirable perſon? Why then do we not love and deſire the ſight of God, in whom all thoſe perfections and graces infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe are united: which alſo we our ſelves, if we ſerve him, are to enjoy as if they were our own?</p>
                     <p>O how great and delightful a Theater ſhall it be to ſee God, as he is, with all his infinite perfections, and the perfections of all Creatures, which are eminently contained in the Deity! How admirable were that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51068:197"/>ſpectacle, where were repreſented all that are or have been pleaſant or admirable in the World! If one were placed where he might behold the ſeaven Wonders of the World, the ſumptuous Banquets made by <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> and other <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, the rare Shews and Feaſts exhibited by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the pleaſant Trees and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Fruits of Paradiſe, the Wealth of <hi>Craeſus, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchs, and all thoſe joyntly together, who would not be tranſported with joy and wonder at ſo admirable a ſight? but more happy were he, upon whom all theſe were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, together with the aſſurance of a thouſand years of life, wherein to enjoy them. Yet all this were nothing in reſpect of the eternal ſight of God, in whom thoſe and all the perfections, that either are or have been, or poſſibly can be, are contained. What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe is great and delightful in the World, together with all the pleaſures and perfections, that all the men in the World have obtained, or ſhall obtain to the World's end, all the wiſdom of <hi>Salomon,</hi> all the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> all the ſtrength of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and <hi>Milo,</hi> all the beauty of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Adonis,</hi> if they ſhould give all theſe things to one perſon, it would have no compariſon, and would ſeem to be a loathſome thing, being compared onely to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which will be enjoyed in ſeeing God for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; becauſe in him onely will be ſeen a Theater of Bliſs and Greatneſs, wherein are compriſed as in one the greatneſs of all creatures. In him will be found all the richneſs of Gold, the delightfulneſs of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the brightneſs of the Sun, the ſweet taſte of Honey, the pleaſantneſs of Muſick, the beauty of the Heavens, the comfortable ſmell of Amber, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfulneſs of all the ſenſes, and all that can be either admired or enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added, that this ineſtimable joy of the viſion of God is to be multiplied into innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other joyes; into as many, as there are bleſſed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51068:197"/>Spirits and Souls which ſhall enjoy the ſight of God, in regard every one is to have a particular content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bliſs of every one.

But ſo many are their joys, and ſo abundant that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, that we are forced to inſiſt further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject. When the <hi>Hebrews</hi> would expreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed perſon, they did not call him bleſſed in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but bleſſings in the abſtract, and plural; and ſo in the firſt Pſalm in place of <hi>Beatus,</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay <hi>Beatitudines,</hi> and certainly with much reaſon: ſince the Bleſſed enjoy as many bleſſings as they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or ſenſes: Bleſſings in their underſtanding, will, and memory; bleſſings in their ſight, hearing, ſmell, taſte and touch. Nay, their bleſſings exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their ſenſes, and the very pores of their bodies; ſo as that life is truly a life entire, total, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, wherein all, that is man, lives in joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Underſtanding ſhall live there with a clear and ſupreme wiſdom, the Will with an inflamed love, the Memory with an eternal repreſentation of the good which is paſt, the Senſes with a continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation in their objects. Finally, all that is man ſhall live in a perpetual joy, comfort, and bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>And to begin with the life and joy of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Bleſſed beſides that ſupreme and clear knowledge of the Creatour, whereof we have already
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:51068:198"/>ſpoken, ſhall know the Divine myſteries, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſenſe of the holy Scriptures; they, ſhall know the number of Saints and Angels as if they were but one; they ſhall know the ſecrets of the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, how many are damned, and for what; they ſhall underſtand the frame and making of the World, the whole artifice of Nature, the motions of the Stars and Planets, the proprieties of Plants, Stones, Birds, and Beaſts, and ſhall not onely know all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but many of thoſe things which God might have created; all which they ſhall not onely know joyntly and in maſs, but clearly and diſtinctly without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.

If then to ſee ſuch imperfect ſcraps of knowledge, divided amongſt ſo many men, would cauſe ſo great admiration, what ſhall be the joy of the Bleſſed: when each particular perſon ſhall ſee his own underſtanding furniſhed with that true and perfect wiſdom; whereof all theirs is but a ſhadow? Who can expreſs the joy they ſhall receive by the knowledge of ſo many truths? What contentment would it be to one, if at once they ſhould ſhew unto him what ever there is, and what is done in the whole Earth: the fair Buildings ſo ſumptuous, all the Fruit-trees of ſo great diverſity, all living Creatures of ſo great variety, all the Birds ſo curiouſly painted, the Fiſhes ſo monſtrous, the Mettals ſo rich, all People and Nations fartheſt remote? certainly it would be a ſight of wonderful ſatisfaction. But what will it be to ſee all this, whatever there is in the Earth, together with all that there is in Heaven and above Heaven? Some Philoſophers in the diſcovery of a natural truth, or the invention of ſome rare curioſity have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a greater joy and content than their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were capable of. For this <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpent ſo many ſleepleſs nights; for this <hi>Pythagoras</hi> travelled into ſo many ſtrange Nations; for this <hi>Crates</hi> deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all his wealth; and <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> writes, never removed his thoughts night nor day from the inquiſition of ſome Mathematical demonſtration. Such content he took in finding out ſome truth, that, when he eat, his mind was buſie in making lines and angles. If he bathed and annointed himſelf, as was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of thoſe times, his two fingers ſerved him in the room of a compaſs to make circles in the oyl, which was upon his skin. He ſpent many dayes in finding out by his Mathematical rules how much gold would ſerve to gild a crown of ſilver, that the Goldſmith
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:51068:199"/>might not deceive him: and having found it, as he was bathing in a Veſſel of braſs, not able to contain his joy, he fetcht divers skips, and cried out, <hi>I have found it, I have found it.</hi> If then the finding out of ſo mean a truth could ſo tranſport this great Artiſt, what joy ſhall the Saints receive, when the Creatour ſhall diſcover unto them thoſe high ſecrets, and above all that ſublime myſterie of the Trinity of perſons in the unity of eſſence? This with the reſt of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledges, wherewith the moſt ſimple of the Juſt ſhall be endued, ſhall ſatiate their Souls with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joyes. O ye wiſe of the World, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant before God, why do you weary your ſelves in vain curioſities, buſie to underſtand, and forgetful to love, intent to know, and ſlow to work? Drye and barren ſpeculation is not the way to knowledge, but devout affection, ardent love, mortification of the ſenſes, and holy works in the ſervice of God. Labour therefore and deſerve, and you ſhall receive more knowledge in one inſtant, than the wiſe of the world have obtained with all their watchings, travails and experiences. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for the great love he bore to knowledge, held that the chief felicity of man conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in contemplation. If he found ſo great joy in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpeculations, what ſhall we find in divine, and the clear viſion of God?</p>
                  <p>There ſhall the Memory alſo live, repreſenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the Divine benefits, and rendring eternal thanks unto the Author of all; the Soul rejoycing in its own happineſs to have received ſo great mercies for ſo ſmall merits, and remembring the dangers, from which it hath been freed by Divine favour, it ſhall ſing the verſe in the Pſalm, <hi>The ſnare is broken and we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</hi> The remembrance likewiſe (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> teaches) of the acts of vertue and good works, by which Heaven was gained, ſhall be a particular joy unto the Bleſſed, both in reſpect they were a means of our happineſs, as alſo of pleaſing ſo gracious and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51068:200"/>good a Lord. This joy, which reſults from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of things paſt, is ſo great, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a way to be ever joyful and pleaſant, adviſes us to preſerve in memory, and to think often of contents paſt. But in Heaven we ſhall not onely joy in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe things, wherein we have pleaſed God in complying with his holy will, and in ordering and diſpoſing our life in his ſervice, but in the troubles alſo and dangers we have paſt. The memory of a good loſt without remedy cauſes great regret and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the contrary, the memory of ſome great evil avoided and danger eſcaped is moſt ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable. The Wiſe-man ſaid the memory of death was bitter, as indeed it is to thoſe, who are to die, but unto the Saints, who have already paſt it, and are ſecure in Heaven, nothing can be more pleaſant: who now to their unſpeakable joy know themſelves to be free from death, infirmity, and danger.</p>
                  <p>There alſo ſhall live the Will in that true and vital life, rejoycing to ſee all its deſires accompliſhed with the abundance and ſweet ſatiety of ſo many felicities; being neceſſitated to love ſo admirable a beauty as the Soul enjoyes and poſſeſſes in God Almighty. Love makes all things ſweet, and as it is a torment to be ſeparated from what one loves, ſo it is a great joy and felicity to remain with the beloved; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bleſſed loving God more than themſelves, how unſpeakable a comfort muſt it be to enjoy God, and the ſociety of thoſe, whom they ſo much affect? The love of the Mother makes her delight more in the ſight of her own Son, though foul and of worſe conditions, than in that of her neighbours. The love then of Saints one towards another, being greater than that of Mothers to their Children, and every one of them being ſo perfect and worthy to be beloved, and every one enjoying the ſight of the ſame God, how comfortable muſt be their converſation?<note place="margin">Sen.

This converſation alſo being with wiſe, holy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet perſonages ſhall much increaſe their joy. For if one of the greateſt troubles of humane life be to ſuffer the ill conditions, follies, and impertinencies of rude and ill-bred people, and the greateſt content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſweet, pious, and learned friends, what ſhall that Divine converſation be in Heaven, where there is none ill conditioned, none impious, none fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but all peace, piety, love, and ſweetneſs? in ſo much as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> 
                     <q>Every one ſhall there rejoyce as much in the felicity of another, as in his own ineffable joy, and ſhall poſſeſs as many joyes, as he ſhall find companions. There are all things, which are either requiſite or delightful, all riches, eaſe, and comfort. Where God is, nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The fear that the good things, which we enjoy, are to end, or at leaſt may end, mingles wormwood with our joyes; and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures do not reliſh, where there is danger. But this Celeſtial happineſs being eternal, neither ſhall nor can end, diminiſh, or be endangered, but with this ſecurity adds a new joy unto thoſe others of the Saints.</p>

The glory of the Saints is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſignified in holy Scripture, under the names of a Supper, Banquet, Manna.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de ſpiritu &amp; vita. Laur.

If <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his Birthright for a diſh of Lentil pottage, well may we mortifie our taſte here upon earth, that we may enjoy that perfect and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The touch alſo ſhall there receive a moſt delightful entertainment. All they tread upon ſhall ſeem unto the Juſt to be flowers, and the whole diſpoſition of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:51068:203"/>their Bodies ſhall be ordered with a moſt ſweet and exquiſite temperature. For as the greateſt penances of the Saints were exerciſed in this ſenſe by the afflictions endured in their Bodies, ſo it is reaſon that this ſenſe ſhould then receive a particular reward. And as the torments of the damned in hell are moſt expreſſed in that ſenſe, ſo the Bodies of the Bleſſed in Heaven are in that ſenſe to receive a ſpecial joy and refreſhment.

This it ſeems was meant by our Saviour in St. <hi>John,</hi> when ſpeaking unto the Father he ſaid; This is life eternal, that is, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, bleſſedneſs (as <hi>Nicholas de Niſe</hi> interprets it) that they know thee the only true God (in which is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the eſſential glory of the Soul,) and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt, in which is noted the eſſential bleſſedneſs of the Senſes: in ſo much as onely in the Humanity of our Saviour the appetite of the Senſes ſhall be ſo perfectly ſatisfied, as they ſhall have no more to deſire, but in it ſhall receive all joy, pleaſure,

                     <p>It is much alſo to be noted, that the bleſſed Souls ſhall be crowned with ſome particular joyes, which the very Angels are not capable of. For firſt it is they onely who are to enjoy the Crowns of Doctors, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and Martyrs, ſince no Angel can have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have ſhed his blood and died for Chriſt: neither to have overcome the fleſh, and by combats and wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſubjected it unto reaſon. Wherefore Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaid, The chaſtity of men was more glorious than that of Angels. Secondly, men ſhall have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their bodies and joy of their ſenſes, which the Angels cannot: For as they want the enemy of the Spirit, which is the Fleſh, ſo they muſt want the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the victory. Neither ſhall they have this great joy of mankind in being redeemed by Chriſt from ſin, and as many damnations into hell, as they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted mortal ſins, and to ſee themſelves now freed and ſecure from that horrid evil, and ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Soul, which they never had: which muſt needs produce a moſt unſpeakable joy.</p>

And therefore we ought often to contemplate the greatneſs of this Land, the length of its eternity, and the breadth and largeneſs of its felicity, which is ſo far extended, that it fills not onely the Soul, but the Body with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory: that glory of the Soul redounding unto the Body, and perfecting it with thoſe four moſt excellent gifts, and repleniſhing it with all felicity which can be imagined or deſired.

                     <hi>Herod</hi> upon the day of his greateſt magnificence could only cloath himſelf in a Robe of ſilver admirably wrought, which did not ſhine of it ſelf, but by reflection of the Sun beams, which then in his riſing caſt his raies upon it: and yet this little glittering was ſufficient to make the people ſalute him as a God. What admiration ſhall it then cauſe to behold the glorious Body of a Saint, not cloathed in Gold or Purple, not adorned with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds or Rubies, but more reſplendent than the Sun it ſelf? Put all the brighteſt Diamonds together, all the faireſt Rubies, all the moſt beautiful Carbuncles: let an Emperial Robe be embroidered with them all: all this will be no more than as coals in reſpect of a glorious body, which ſhall be all tranſparent, bright, and reſplendent far more than if it were ſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. O the baſeneſe of worldly riches! they all put together could not make a Garment ſo ſpecious and beautiful. If here we account it for a bravery to wear a Diamond Ring upon our fingers, and women glory in ſome Carbuncle dangling at their breaſts, what ſhall it be to have our hands, feet, arid breaſts themſelves more glorious and reſplendent than all the Jewels of the World? The Garments which we wear here, how rich ſoever, are rather an affront and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace unto us than an ornament, ſince they argue an imperfection and a neceſſity of our bodies, which we are forced to ſupply with ſomething of another mature. Beſides our cloathes were given as a mark of <hi>Adams</hi> fall in Paradiſe, and we wear them as a penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned for his Sin. And what fool ſo impudent and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:51068:205"/>ſottiſh, as to beſtow precious trimming upon a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Garment? But ſuch are not the Ornaments of the Saints in Heaven; their luſtre is their own, not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from their Garments, not extrinſecal without them, but within their very entrails, each part of them being more tranſparent than Chryſtal, and brighter than the Sun. It is recounted in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> as a great wonder, that a Woman was ſeen cloathed with the Sun, and crowned with twelve Stars. This indeed was far more glorious than any Ornament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, where we hold it for a great bravery to be adorned with twelve rich Diamonds and a Carbuncle; and what are thoſe in compariſon of the Sun and ſo many Stars? Yet this is ſhort of the Ornament of the Saints, whoſe luſtre is proper to themſelves, intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally their own, not taken and borrowed from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without them, as was that of the Womans. The State and Majeſty, with which this gift of ſplendor ſhall adorn the Saints, ſhall be incomparably greater than that of the mightieſt Kings. It were a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in a Prince, when he iſſues forth of his Palace by night, to be attended by a thouſand Pages, each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a lighted Torch; but were thoſe Torches Stars, it were nothing to the ſtate and glory of a Saint in Heaven, who carries with him a light equal to that of the Sun ſeaven times doubled; and what greater glory than not to need the Sun, which the whole World needs? Where the Juſt is, ſhall be no night; for whereſoever he goes, he carries the day along with him. What greater authority can there be than to ſhine far brighter than the Sun, carrying with him far greater Majeſty than all the men of the Earth could be able to conferre upon him, if they went accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him, carrying lighted Torches in their hands? St. <hi>Paul</hi> beholding the gift of Clarity in the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt remained for ſome dayes without ſenſe or motion. And St. <hi>John</hi> onely beholding it in the face of our Saviour fell down as if dead, his mortal eyes not

St. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he ſaw ſomething of it in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of Chriſt, was ſo tranſported with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the place, that he had a deſire to have continued there for ever. Neither was this much in Chriſt, ſince the people of Iſrael were not able to ſuffer the beams which iſſued from the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though then in a frail and mortal body.<note place="margin">Caeſar. lib. <hi>12.</hi> mir. cap. <hi>54.</hi>

                     <hi>Caeſarius</hi> writes of a great Doctor of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> who being ready to give up his ghoſt, wondered how it could be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Almighty God could make his body compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of duſt to ſhine like the Sun. But our Lord being pleaſed to comfort and ſtrengthen him in the belief of the Article of the Reſurrection, cauſed ſo great a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to iſſue forth of the feet of the ſick perſon, that his eyes not being able to ſuffer ſo great a ſplendor, he was forced to hide them under his Bed-cloathes. But much more is it, that in bodies already dead this glory ſhould appear. The body of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſent forth ſuch beams of light, that they ſeemed to be like thoſe of Heaven. The ſplendor alſo of other dead bodies of the Saints hath been ſuch, that mortal eyes were not able to behold them. If then this Garment of light do beautifie thoſe dead bodies without ſouls, how ſhall it illuſtrate thoſe beautiful and perfect bodies in Heaven, who are alive, and animated with their glorious ſpirits for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? St. <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> ſaid, that the light of this inferiour World was the honour and ornament of all things. How ſhall then the immortal light of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory deck and adorn the Saints? for it ſhall not onely make them ſhine with that bright candor, we have already ſpoken of, but with diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſhall imbelliſh ſome particular parts more than others. In the Crowns of Virgins it ſhall be moſt white, in that of Martyrs red, in that of Doctors of ſome particular brightneſs. Neither ſhall thoſe marks of glory be only in their heads or faces, but in the

                     <p>As all the bodies of Saints are to be wholly filled with light, ſo they are to enjoy the priviledges of light: which amongſt all material qualities is enobled with this prerogative, that it hath no contrary, and is therefore impaſſible. And ſo the glorious bodies of the Saints, having nothing that may oppoſe them, are alſo freed from ſufferance. Beſides, nothing is more ſwift than light; and therefore thoſe bodies, who have the greateſt ſhare of light, are alſo the moſt ſwift in motion; whereupon there is no Element ſo nimble and active as fire: no nature ſo ſwift as that of the Sun and Stars; and light it ſelf is ſo quick, that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it illuminates the whole Sphere of its activity. In like manner the glorious bodies of the Saints, as they are to enjoy more light, ſo they are to move with more ſpeed and agility than the very Stars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The light is alſo ſo ſubtle and pure, that it ſtops not in its paſſage, although it meets with ſome
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:51068:206"/>bodies ſolid and maſſie. The whole Sphere and body of the Air hinders not the. Sun from enlightning us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and Chryſtal, Diamonds, Glaſs, and other heavy bodies are penetrated by light. But far greater ſhall be the ſubtility and purity of the bleſſed bodies, unto whoſe paſſage nothing how groſs or opake ſoever ſhall be an obſtacle. For this reaſon the Saints in holy Scripture are often called by the name of Light: and particularly it is ſaid, that the wayes of the Juſt are like a ſhining light at midday. For as the light, becauſe impaſſible, makes his way through dirty and unclean places without defiling its purity, paſſes with ſpeed and penetrates other bodies, that ſtand in its way: So the Saints endowed with the light, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from this gift of Clarity, cannot ſuffer from any thing, having an agility to move with ſpeed from place to place, and a ſubtlety to penetrate whereſoever they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>The goods reſulting from theſe privileges and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the glorious bodies are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than all the evills of this mortal life. The onely gift of impaſſibility frees us from all thoſe miſeries, which our bodies now ſuffer: the cold of Winter, the heat of Summer, infirmities, griefs, tears, and the neceſſity of eating, which one neceſſity includes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others. Let us but conſider what cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles men undergoe onely to ſuſtain their lives. The Labourer ſpends his dayes in plowing, ſowing, and reaping: The Shepheard ſuffers cold and heat in watching of his flock: The Servant in obeying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will and command: The Rich man in cares and fears in preſerving what he poſſeſſes. What dangers are paſt in all eſtates onely to be ſure to eat? from all which the gift of impaſſibility exempts the Juſt. The care of cloathing troubles us alſo little leſs than that of feeding: and that of preſerving our health much more. For as our neceſſities are doubly encreaſed by ſickneſs, ſo are our cares; from all which he, who is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:51068:207"/>impaſſible, is free: and not onely from the griefs and pains of this life, but if he ſhould enter into hell, it would not burn one hair of him.</p>
                     <p>The Prerogative alſo of the gift of agility is moſt great; which eaſily appears by the troubles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a long journey, which (howſoever we are accommodated) is not performed without much wearineſs, and oftentimes with danger both of health and life. A King though he paſs in a Coach or Litter after the moſt eaſie and commodious way of travelling, muſt paſs over rocks, hills, and rivers, and ſpend much time; but with the gift of agility a Saint in the twinkling of an eye will place himſelf where he pleaſes, and paſs millions of leagues with as much eaſe and in as ſhort a time, as a furlong. We admire the Story of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> who in one day paſſed from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Portugal</hi> to free his Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned wrongfully to death; and at that of St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Patriarch of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who in a ſhort time tranſported himſelf from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Colen,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome</hi> without being miſſed, leſs than in two hours ſpace. If to the mortal bodies of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants God communicates ſuch gifts, what ſhall he do to the glorified bodies of his Saints? What an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of nature were it to be able in one day to viſit all the great Kingdoms of the Earth, and ſee what paſſed amongſt them, in an hour to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> the chief City of the World: from thence to paſs to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> the head of the Eaſtern Empire: In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour to the <hi>Great Cair,</hi> and conſider there the immenſe multitude of the Inhabitants: In another hour goe to <hi>Goa</hi> the Court of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Riches thereof: in another to <hi>Pequin,</hi> the Seat of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> and contemplate the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that prodigious City: in another to <hi>Meaco</hi> the Court of <hi>Japonia:</hi> in another to <hi>Manila</hi> the head Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Philippin</hi> Iſlands: in another to <hi>Ternate</hi> in the <hi>Maluca's:</hi> in another to <hi>Lima</hi> in <hi>Peru:</hi> in another

If this were a great priviledge, what ſhall that be of thoſe glorious bodies, who in a ſhort ſpace can traverſe all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, viſit the Earth, return unto the Sun, and Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there obſerve what is above the Starrs in the Empyrial Heaven?<note place="margin">Greg. li. <hi>3.</hi> Dial. <hi>36.</hi>
                        </note> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> writes in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, that a Souldier aſſaulting a holy perſonage, and having his naked ſword lifted up and ready to give the blow, the man cried out to his Patron St. <hi>John</hi> for help, who inſtantly withheld the Souldiers hand, that he could not move it. How ſoon did <hi>St. John</hi> hear him in Heaven, who invoked him upon Earth? with what ſpeed did he deſcend to aſſiſt him, with-holding and drying up the arm of the wicked Souldier? the bodies of the Saints are to move here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with no leſs ſpeed, than their ſpirits do now; the weight of their bodies ſhall no wayes hinder them; they ſhall therefore in the ſame manner walk or ſtay upon Water, Air, Heavens, as upon Earth. It was miraculous in <hi>St. Quirinus</hi> Martyr, <hi>St. Maurus,</hi> and <hi>St. Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula,</hi> that they walked upon waters, paſſed rapid rivers and ſeas without Veſſels; but the glorious bodies ſhall not onely be able to traverſe the ſeas, mount into the air, but enter into flames ſecure and without hurt. It is ſaid of <hi>S. Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſium,</hi> that in the fervour of his prayers and contemplations he was ſeen lifted up into the air; and the great Servant of God Father <hi>Diego Martines,</hi> of the Society of Jeſus, was lifted up in prayer above the higheſt trees and Towers, and hanging in the air perſiſted in his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If God vouchſafe ſo great favours to his ſervants in this valley of tears, what priviledges will he deny to the Citizens of Heaven?</p>
                     <p>To this ſo notable gift of Agility ſhall be annexed that of Penetration: by which their glorious bodies ſhall
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:51068:208"/>have their way free and pervious through all places; no impediment ſhall ſtop their motion, and for them ſhall be no priſon or encloſure. They ſhall with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaſe paſs through the middle of a rock, than an arrow through the air. It ſhall be the ſame thing for them to mount unto the Moon, where they ſhall meet no ſolid body to oppoſe them, as to pierce unto the center through rocks, mettals, and the groſs body of the earth. We wonder to hear that the <hi>Zahories</hi> ſee thoſe things, which are hid under the earth. Let us admire that which is certain, that the Saints cannot onely ſee, but enter into the profundity of the earth, and tell what minerals and other ſecrets are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its entrails. <hi>Metaphraſtes</hi> writes, that a certain <hi>Goth,</hi> a Souldier of the Garriſon of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> fell paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in love with a Maid of the ſame City, and ſind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way to enjoy her, demanded her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but the Mother and Kindred gave no ear to the treaty, truſting little to a Barbarian and a Stranger, who carrying her into a Country far diſtant (as his was) might there uſe her at his pleaſure. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier notwithſtanding perſiſting ſtill in his ſuit with many promiſes of good entertainment, gained at laſt the conſent of the Maid and her Friends, onely the Mother would not be ſatisfied, before they had entred all together into the Temple of the holy Martyrs <hi>St. Samona, Curia,</hi> and <hi>Abiba,</hi> and that there the Souldier had renewed his promiſes by ſolemn oath, and called the holy Martyrs as witneſſes; which done, the Maid was delivered unto him; whom he not much after carried into his own Country, where he was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married, and had his Wife yet living. There bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conceal his wickedneſs he fell into a greater, and like a wild beaſt without pity encloſed the poor woman alive in a Sepulcher, and there left her. She thus betrayed, had recourſe unto the Saints, whom ſhe with tears invoked as witneſſes of the Souldiers treachery and breach of faith. At the inſtant the holy
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51068:208"/>Martyrs appeared in a glorious equipage, and caſting her into a gentle ſleep, conveyed her (the Sepulcher ſtill remaining lockt) without hurt into her own Country, where they left her. The Barbarian igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what had happened, and perſwading himſelf ſhe was long fince dead, returned a ſecond time to <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> where convinced of the crime he ſatisfied it with his life. If the Saints then have power to make the perſons of others paſs through diſtinct bodies, much more are they able to make their own to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate them without impediment.</p>
                     <p>Finally the Servants of Chriſt ſhall be there ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with all goods both of ſoul and body, that there ſhall be nothing more for them to deſire.

The anſwer was ready; all cried out, That dayes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. With this he engaged them to make warr upon the <hi>Medes,</hi> aſſuring them, that after a ſhort trouble in ſubduing an effeminate Nation, they ſhould enjoy incomparable pleaſure, and be Maſters of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable riches. This ſerved him to make the <hi>Perſians</hi> follow him, and conquer the Kingdom of the <hi>Medes.</hi> If this motive were ſufficient to make a barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preferre a doubtful reward before a certain and hazardous labour, why ſhould not a certain reward, and infinitely greater than the labour ſuffice us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? Let us compare that Celeſtial Supper of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life with the troubles of this, The greatneſs of the Kingdom of Heaven with the littleneſs of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, The joyes above with the goods below, and our labours will ſeem feaſts, our ſervices repoſe, and the felicity of earth miſery and baſeneſs. What is the honour of this life, which is in it ſelf falſe, given by lying men, ſhort and limited, in reſpect of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Juſt receive in Heaven, which is true, given by God, eternal, extended through the Heavens, and manifeſted to all that are in them, Men and Angels? What are the riches of the Earth, which often fail, are ever full of dingers and cares, and never free their owners from neceſſity, in compariſon of thoſe which have no end, and give all ſecurity and abundance?
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:51068:209"/>What are their ſhort pleaſures, which prejudice the health, conſume the ſubſtance, and make infamous thoſe who ſeek them, in reſpect of thoſe immenſe joyes of glory, which with delight joyn honour and profit? What is this life of miſery to that full of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and happineſs: and what thoſe evil qualities of our bodies now to thoſe precious gifts of glory after our reſurrection? We are now all rottenneſs, unweil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, corruption, uncleanneſs, infirmities, loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worms. Then all ſhall be light, incorruption, ſplendor, purity, beauty, and immortality. Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe together, what difference there is betwixt a body ſickly, weak, pale, and loathſome, or ſome eight dayes after death full of worms, corruption and ſtench abominable, with the ſame body being now in glory, exceeding the Sun far in brightneſs, the Heavens in beauty, more odoriferous than the pureſt Roſes or Lillies.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the evils, or goods temporal bear any compariſon with the eternal; ſince, as the Apoſtle ſayes, That which is momentary and light does cauſe an eternal weight of glory. In the beginning of the Civil Warres with the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Fulvius Gracchus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Val. l. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> the Conſul <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> by publick Edict promiſed, that whoſoever ſhould bring him the head of <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> ſhould receive for reward its weight in gold. All eſteemed this a recompence highly to be valued, that one ſhould receive equal weight of that precious mettal to the weight of dead fleſh. But God's promiſes far exceed this. For a labour or trouble as light as a feather he gives eternal weight of glory. The Apoſtle ſayes not, that God Almighty doth give onely a great weight for light merits, out alſo adds over and above, that it ſhall be eternal. It were a great happineſs, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our penances or voluntary labours we ſhould receive onely equal proportion of bliſs, yet ſo as it were eternal; becauſe how little ſoever it were, it
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:51068:210"/>were to be purchaſed at a very cheap rate, though it were in ſubſtance but ſo much for ſo much, ſo that the difference were onely ſuch in the duration thereof: as if for the toyl of one dayes labour were given a whole year of reſt. But Almighty God giving much for a little, for that which is light maſſie and heavy, for a thing momentary an eternal reward, what greater encreaſe or advantage can we poſſibly receive? <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muleyus</hi> will be a great confuſion unto us, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foreſaid Proclamation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, ſtuck not at any toil or danger, until he had cut off the head of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> greedy of the equal weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in gold. Let us have the like courage the Souldier had to take away the temporal life of a Man, to the end we may not bereave our ſelves of an eternal life. And ſince the purchaſe of Heaven is ſo cheap, let us procure to augment the gain, and let's not have leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of goods eternal, than <hi>Setimuleyus</hi> had for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: who deſirous of a great reward filled with melted lead all the hollow places of the head, which he had cut off. Let us fill our momentary and light works with great affection and love. Let us increaſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and in any work how little ſoever accompany the ſame with a great will, with a vehement deſire to hoard up eternal treaſures for temporal pains. What an advantagious exchange will it be to buy Heaven for a draught of water, for that which is but vile, and laſts but a moment that which is of ineſtimable price, and is to laſt for all eternity? What ſort of bargain would it be, if one could buy a Kingdom for a ſtraw? yet ſo it is. For that which is no more worth than a Straw we may purchaſe the Kingdom of Heaven. Certainly all the felicity, riches, and earthly delights are no more than a ſtraw compared with the glory of Heaven. How fond and fooliſh would he be, who having a Basket full of chips, would not give one of them for an hundred weight of gold? This is the ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs of men, that for earthly goods they will not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:51068:210"/>receive thoſe of Heaven. Who is there, that having offered him a precious ſtone for ſome ſmall ſand, ſhould not have ſo much wit, as to give a thing ſo baſe and abject for a thing ſo noble and precious? Who being offered a rich treaſure for an handful of cinders, would not admit of ſo gainful an exchange? What hunger-ſtarved man being invited to a full Table of dainty diſhes upon condition he ſhould not eat an apple pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, would reject the invitation? Heaven is offered us for things little and of ſmall eſtimation. Why do not we accept the offer? Chriſt our Saviour called the Kingdom of Heaven a precious Margarite and a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Treaſure: for which we ought to forſake all the goods of the earth: by reaſon they are all but duſt and miſery in reſpect of a treaſure of Pearls and Diamonds, St. <hi>Joſaph at</hi> did very much in leaving an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a greater aſſurance of that of Heaven. He did very much according to our deceitful apprehenſion and falſe eſtimation of things. But if it be well conſidered, he did very little, much leſs, than if he had given one Basketful of Earth for another of Gold, a Sack full of Small-coal for a great Treaſure, and a Nut-ſhell for a great Banquet. Whatever is in the Earth may well be given for the leaſt crum of Heaven; becauſe all the greatneſſes of this World are but crums, nut-ſhells, and traſh compared with the leaſt particle of heavenly bliſs. All the felicity upon Earth hath no ſubſtance nor weight, if compared with the weight of eternal glory, which is prepared for us. This <hi>David</hi> did, and convinced by the greatneſs of heavenly glory, ſaid unto our Lord: <hi>I did eneline my heart to doe thy juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</hi> The heart of man is like a juſt ballance, that inclines that way, where is the greateſt weight. And as in the heart of <hi>David</hi> the temporal weighed little, and the eternal much, ſo inclined by the eternal weight of glory which attends us, and moved by the hope of ſo great a reward, the fulfilling of the Law of God prevailed more with him, than his own appetite and inclination.</p>

To St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> all the torments of Hell ſeemed not much for the gaining of Celeſtial glory but for ſome ſhort time. And if we conſider the greatneſs of that joy, all the penances of St. <hi>Simon Stylites,</hi> the faſts of St. <hi>Romualdus,</hi> the poverty and nakedneſs of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and the ſcorns and affronts put upon St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> are no more than the taking up of a ſtraw for the gaining of an earthly Empire. All Stories are full for how ſmall matters upon earth men have expoſed themſelves to great and almoſt certain dangers. Becauſe <hi>David</hi> cauſed it to be publiſhed in his Army, that he that ſhould firſt ſet upon the <hi>Jebuſeans,</hi> who were the hardieſt of all his Enemies, ſhould be made General, <hi>Joab</hi> doubted not to expoſe his life to manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, breaking through the Pikes and Launces to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that honour at the price of his own blood. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe King <hi>Saul</hi> publiſhed in the Army, that he would give his Daughter in Matrimony to him, that ſhould overcome the Giant <hi>Golias,</hi> there being none found that durſt attempt it, <hi>David</hi> ſlighted all danger in hopes of obtaining ſuch a recompense. What have not men attempted to gain a terreſtrial reward? Nothing hath ſeemed much unto them. For the gaining then of Heaven all things ought to ſeem little unto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. <hi>Seneca</hi> wondered at what Souldiers did and ſuffered for ſo ſhort and tranſitory Kingdoms as are thoſe of the Earth, and that not for themſelves, but for another. Much more may we wonder that the ſufferings and labours of this life, by which we are to gain the Kingdom of Heaven, not for a ſtranger, but
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:51068:211"/>for our ſelves, ſeem ſo great and grievous unto us. What did not <hi>Jesbaam</hi> perform for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> though he was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a poor wretch and a daſtard?<note place="margin">

If for a Kingdom of another Man's Dominions theſe men were ſo valiant, why do not we take courage, and procure with great valour to make conqueſt of the Kingdom of Heaven, though we loſe all our ſtrength, and even our lives in the Conqueſt, ſince in reſpect of it all toil and labour is nothing? For the advancing then of the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> his worthies performed ſuch actions, as, if they were not authoriſed by holy Scripture, might ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.

If men undergoe ſuch hazards for the Kingdom, nay for the pleaſure of another, and that momentary, what ought we to do for thoſe eternal joyes, which are to be our own, and for the Kingdom of Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we expect ſuch immenſe honours, riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? Why do we not all take heart and courage? It is the Kingdom of Heaven we hope for, joyes, riches, and honours eternal are thoſe, which are promiſed us.

When they hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up on high upon the Rack, and the Tyrant in a ſcoff demanded of him, where he then was, the Saint ſmiling and beholding Heaven, whither he was going, anſwered, <q>I am aloft, and from thence can deſpiſe thee, although inſolent and puft up with the power thou haſt upon Earth.</q> Being after mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with more cruel torments, he ſaid, <q>Me-thinks thou doſt not threaten, but court me, <hi>Dacianus,</hi> with what I deſire with all the powers and faculties of my Soul.</q> And when they tore his fleſh with hooks and pincers, and burnt him with lighted torches, he cried out with great joy, <q>In vain thou wearieſt thy ſelf, <hi>Dacianus,</hi> thou canſt not imagine torments ſo horrid, which I could not ſuffer. Priſon, Pincers, Burning-plates of iron, and Death it ſelf are unto Chriſtians ſports and recreations, and not torments.</q> He who had the joyes of Heaven before his eyes ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laughed at the bittereſt torments upon Earth. Let us conſider them alſo, and we ſhall not ſhun the ſufferance of any thing, whereby we may gain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. What pity is it, that a Chriſtian for ſome ſhort and ſordid pleaſure ſhould loſe joyes ſo great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: becauſe he will not bear ſome ſlight injurie here, ſhould be deprived of celeſtial honour there: for not paying what he owes, and not reſtoring what he hath unjuſtly taken, ſhould forfeit the divine rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Heaven: and for one pleaſant morſel, which the Devil offers him, ſhould deprive himſelf of that great Supper, whereunto God invites him? Who would
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51068:213"/>chooſe rather to feed upon bones and craps, which fell from the Table, than to he a Gueſt at the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and feed upon the choiceſt and moſt ſavoury diſhes? That which the world offers in her beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, is but ſhells, offals, and parings; but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto God invites us, is a full Table, wherein may be ſatisfied the moſt eager hunger of humane appetite. With reaſon it is called in holy Scripture the great Supper, and in ſome places the Nuptial Supper, by reaſon of that ſatiety, which nothing upon earth can give us. It is called alſo a Supper, and not a Dinner, becauſe after dinner we uſe to riſe, and goe about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions and employments, but after ſupper there are no more labours; all is reſt and repoſe. The principal diſh, which is ſerved in at this great Supper, is the clear viſion of God, and all his Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; after that a thouſand joyes of the Soul in all its powers and faculties: then a thouſand pleaſures of the ſenſes, with all the endowments of a glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Theſe latter are as it were the Deſert of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Banquet. And if the Deſert be ſuch, what ſhall be the ſubſtance of the Feaſt? What compariſon then betwixt thoſe great and eternal goods of Heaven, and thoſe which the World gives us? Certainly they are not worthy to be called ſo much as the ſhells of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be reflected on, that thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not that great Supper, which is a figure of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were not deprived of it by doing any thing, which was a ſin in it ſelf. For one excuſed himſelf, becauſe he had bought a Farm: another becauſe he was to prove his Oxen: a third becauſe he was married: none of which were ſins; but for the preferring thoſe things before the Kingdom of Heaven, which being an incredible madneſs and blindneſs, made them not worthy to be admitted. And truly all thoſe, who are wholly taken up and employed in the things of the Earth, do no other than perferre the ſcraps and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:51068:213"/>of a poor and ruſtick Dinner before the Royal Feaſt of a powerful King. Moreover although God had not invited us moſt miſerable and vile worms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Supper of ſo infinite ſweetneſs, but had onely promiſed us the crums, which fell from his Table, yet ought we to have preferred them before the contents and commodities of this World. Let us fear leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in lawful pleaſures there may be danger. For as the evils of ſin are the cauſe of damnation, ſo the goods of the world may be the occaſion of ſin. Let us look onely towards Heaven: let us open our eyes and conſider, that thoſe who were called by God to ſome eſpecial vocation, and did not embrace it, are introduced by holy Scripture as damned, and forſaken by God; though their ſin is not named, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in theſe three, who were invited; But much more to our terrour in that young man in the Goſpel, who having demanded of Chriſt our Redeemer, What he ſhould do to gain eternal life, and being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he ſhould keep the Commandements of the Law, which he replyed he had done from his youth, Yet becauſe the Lord called him by a ſpecial vocation to a greater perfection, which was to leave all and follow him, he went his way ſorrowful, becauſe he had much riches; whereupon our Saviour pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that memorable and terrible Sentence, That it was eaſier for a Camel to enter the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven; ſignifying thereby, that although he had kept the Commandments, yet he was excluded Heaven. For thoſe, whom our Saviour favours with particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations and callings, do not aſſure their ſalvation by a deſire to keep the Commandments, but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to obſerve the Evangelical counſels, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not onely ſins and the occaſions of ſinning, but the impediments of vertue and perfection, by which they might not onely more aſſure Heaven, but alſo obtain more glory; and if they do it not, may juſtly
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51068:214"/>fear leſt they may ſo much diſoblige God Almighty by deſpiſing his vocation, that he will not vouchſafe to grant them the efficacious helps of keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Little is all which can be done for the gaining of Heaven, little what is ſuffered, little what is forſaken, little all the care to obtain it, little what caution not to loſe it, little what impediments are to to be avoided, little what auſterities of life we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe to aſſure it. And if we judge not ſo in this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of tears, let the Saints judge in Heaven, who are of a different opinion from thoſe upon earth.<note place="margin">D.

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have not only reaſon to deſpiſe the Goods of the World from the conſideration of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the Evils alſo from that of Hell, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of which all temporal evils are to be eſteemed as happineſs and bleſſings, and all the happineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Earth to be abhorred as evils, at leaſt if they any wayes diſpoſe to thoſe eternal torments, and that perpetual privation of joyes without end. And truly ſuch are the two extremes which attend us after life, that either of them were ſufficient to make us deſpiſe all Goods and Evils temporal whatſoever. But joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the privation of the joyes of Heaven with the condemnation unto the torments of Hell, 'tis admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how any can delight in the things of this life, and not tremble at what may ſucceed. By reaſon of this danger we ought to abhorre and ſpit at the pleaſures and goods of this life, and to admit and embrace, if occaſion be, the greateſt evils of it, and to contemn both the one and the other, neither loving the goods, nor fearing the evils. Yet certainly the goods of the World are ſo much more to be deſpiſed than the evils, as they uſually are the greater occaſions of ſin, and ſo conſequently of eternal damnation. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Writings of Saints are full of menaces againſt the Rich, the Proſperous, and the Lovers of the World, who are thoſe, which for the moſt part people Hell.

                     <note place="margin">Bernard. in Medit.</note> who ſayes, <q>Tell me now, Where are thoſe lovers of the world, who a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe were here with us? there is nothing remaining of them but duſt and worms. Mark diligently what they once were, and what they now are. They were men, as thou now art, they did eat, drink, laugh, and paſs away their times in mirth and jollity, and in a moment of time ſunk down into hell. Here are their Bodies eaten by worms, and their Souls condemned to eternal flames, until united again they both ſhall ſink together into everlaſting fire, that ſo thoſe who were companions in ſin, may be alſo in torments, and that one pain involve them, who were conſorts in the love of the ſame offence. What did their vain glory profit them, their ſhort mirth, their worldly power, their fleſhly pleaſure, their falſe riches, their numerous families? where is now their laughter, their jeſts, their boaſting, their arrogance? how great ſhall be their ſorrow, when ſuch miſery ſhall ſucceed ſo many pleaſures: when from the height of humane glory they ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe grievous torments and eternal ruine, where according to what the Wiſe-man ſaid, the mighty ſhall be mightily puniſhed?</q>

                  <p>If then thoſe, who moſt enjoy the World, run the greateſt hazard of being damned, what can more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to the contempt of it, than the conſideration of ſo lamentable an end? And what can more ſet forth the malice of temporal goods, than to be the occaſion of eternal evils? If a curious built houſe be ſubject to ſome notable inconveniency, no man will dwell in it; if a couragious horſe have ſome vitious quality, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will buy him; and if a Chryſtal cup have a crack, it ſhall not be placed upon a Royal Cupboard; yet the pleaſures and goods of the World, though ſubject to all thoſe faults, how are they coveted, loved, and ſought after, and in them our perdition? Certainly, if we ſhould conſider ſeriouſly the eternal evils, which correſpond to the ſhort pleaſures of this life, we ſhould have all humane felicity in horrour, and trembling to ſee our ſelves in fortunes favour ſhould flye from the world as from death. The reverend and zealous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frier <hi>Jordan,</hi> being deſirous to convert a certain Cavalier to God and from the love of the world, for his laſt remedy had recourſe unto this conſideration. Seeing him a beautiful young man, active, and well diſpoſed of body, he ſaid unto him: At leaſt Sir, ſince God hath bellowed ſo comely a face and perſonage upon you, think what pity it were they ſhould be the food of eternal fire, and burn without end. The Gentleman reflected upon his advice; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration wrought ſo much with him, that abhorring the world, and quitting all his poſſeſſions and hopes, he became poor in Chriſt, and entred into Religion.</p>

                     <p>Let us now come to the conſideration of Eternal Evils. that from thence we may deſpiſe all which is temporal, be it good or bad. The evils of Hell are truly evils, and ſo purely ſuch, that they have no mixture of good. In that place of unhappineſs all is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51068:216"/>eternal ſorrow and complaint, and there is no room for comfort.<note place="margin">Aelian. lib. <hi>3.</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: Hiſt. c. <hi>18.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Aelian</hi> relates a Hiſtory, which being taken as a Parable, may ſerve to illuſtrate what we are about to ſpeak of. He ſayes in the utmoſt borders of the <hi>Meropes</hi> there is a cetrain place called <hi>Anoſtos,</hi> which is as much to ſay, from whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. There was to be ſeen a great Precipice, and a deep opening of the earth, from whence iſſued two Rivers, the one of Joy, and the other of Sadneſs: upon the brinks of which grew divers trees of ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fruits, that thoſe who eat of the one, forgot all that might cauſe grief, but thoſe who eat of the other were ſo poſſeſſed with an unconſolable ſadneſs, that all was weeping and lamentations, until they at laſt died with ſigns and ſhedding of tears. What do thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſignifie, but the one of them that, whereof <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks, which with his current rejoyced the City of God: the other that Flood of evil, which enters the Priſon of Hell, and fills it with groans, tears, and deſpite without the leaſt hope of comfort? for there ſhall the door be eternally ſhut to all good or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eaſe; in ſo much as one drop of water was denied the rich Glutton from ſo merciful and pitiful a man as <hi>Abraham.</hi> There ſhall not be the leaſt good that may give eaſe, nor ſhall there want a concourſe of all evils which may add affliction. There is no good to be found there, where all goods are wanting: neither can there be want of any evil, where all evils whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are to be found; and by the want of all good, and the collection of all evils every evil is augmented. In the creation of the World God gave a praiſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nature, ſaying, It was good without farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration; but when all were created and joyned together, he ſaid They were very good, becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of many goods advances the good of each particular: and in the ſame manner the conjunction of many evils makes all of them worſe. What ſhall Heaven then be, where there is a concourſe of all
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:51068:216"/>goods, and no evils? And what Hell, where there are all evils, and no good? Certainly the one muſt be exceeding good, and the other exceeding evil. In ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of which the Lord ſhewed unto the Prophet <hi>Jeremias</hi> two little Baskets of Figs:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.</note> in the one of which were exceſſively good ones, and in the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively bad, both in extremity. He does not content himſelf in ſaying they were bad, or very bad: but ſayes, they were over-bad: becauſe they repreſented the miſerable ſtate of the Damned, where is to be the ſink of all evils without mixture of any good at all. And for this reaſon it is not a ſufficient expreſſion to ſay, they are evils: but they are to be tearmed evils exceſſively great.</p>
                     <p>No man will admire this, who knows the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a mortal ſin; for committing of which, as he is a man, he deſerves hell, and as he is Chriſtian, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) a new hell: that is, an Infidel merits one hell, and a Chriſtian two, who knowing Chriſt incarnate and crucified for him durſt yet ſin and offend him. Sin is an exceſſive evil, becauſe it is an infinite evil: and therefore it is not too much, if it be chatized with infinite evils. It is an evil, which is greater than the whole collection of all other evils; and for this reaſon 'tis not too much rigour, that the ſinner ſhould be chaſtized with the collection of all evils together. Thoſe who wonder at the terribleneſs of eternal pains, know not the terribleneſs of ſin. Whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>21.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <q>Therefore the eternal pains ſeem hard and injuſt unto humane apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe in the weakneſs of our natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſenſe of that eternal wiſdom is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which might be perceived the great malice of the firſt prevatication.</q> If then for that firſt ſin committed, when Chriſt had not yet died for man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal damnation was not thought too much, what ſhall it be, when we know that our Redeemer was ſo gracious as to give his life, becauſe we ſhould not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:51068:217"/>ſin? From the neceſſity of ſo coſtly and precious a Medecine may be collected the greatneſs of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I ſay the greatneſs, and danger of a diſeaſe is known by the extraordinary remedies which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto it, and by the things which are ſought out for the cure, and without which the malady would be without remedy. We may therefore gather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite malice of a mortal ſin, becauſe there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means ſufficient, but one ſo extraordinary, as was God to become Man, and give his own life for Man, dying a death ſo ſhameful, and painful as he did: offering a price ſo great, as was the exceſſive worth and infinite price of his merits and paſſion. Sin is an injurie againſt God; and as the injurie increaſes according to the greatneſs and worth of the perſon offended, ſo, God being infinite, the injury becomes of infinite malice: and as God is a good, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all goods, ſo a mortal ſin, which is an injury done unto him, is a miſchief which exceeds all evils, and ought to be puniſhed with all pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:51068:217"/>they deprive him of God, in whom they are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. This is the greateſt pain that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. O how miſerable and poor muſt the damned Soul be, who hath loſt God for all eternity? He, who is condemned by humane Laws to the loſs of his goods, may, if he live, gain others, at leaſt in another Kingdom, if he flye thither; but he who is deprived of God, where ſhall he find another God? and who can flye from Hell? God is the greateſt good, and it is therefore the greateſt evil to be deprived of him; Becauſe (as St. <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> ſayes) evil is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good, and that is to be eſteemed the greateſt evil, which is a privation of the greateſt good, which is God, and muſt certainly therefore cauſe more grief and reſentment in the Damned, than all the torments and puniſhments of Hell beſides. And in regard there is in Hell an eternal privation of God, who is the chief Good, the pain of Loſs, whereby one is deprived for ever of the greateſt of all goods, this privation will cauſe the greateſt pain and torment. If the burning of a hand cauſe an inſufferable pain, by reaſon that the exceſſive heat deprives the Body of its natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and good conſtitution, which is but a poor and ſhort good, how ſhall he be tormented, who is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and eternally ſeparated from ſo great a Good as is God? If a bone diſplaced or out of joynt cauſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable grief, becauſe it is deprived of his due ſtate and place, what ſhall it cauſe in a rational creature, to lye eternally ſeparated from God, who is the chief end, for which he was created?<note place="margin">Chryſ. <hi>24.</hi> in Math.

                        </note> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives us ſome underſtanding of this grief, when he ſayes, <q>He, who burns in Hell, loſes alſo the Kingdom of Heaven, which is certainly a greater puniſhment than that torment of flames. I know many who are afraid of Hell; but I dare confidently ſay, that the amiſſion of glory is far more bitter than all thoſe pains, which are to be ſuffered in Hell. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this cannot be expreſt in words, ſince we
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:51068:218"/>know not well the happineſs of thoſe divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the want of which we ought alſo to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the infelicity of their loſs; but we ſhall then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt learn, when we are taught by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</q> Then our eyes ſhall be opened; then the vail ſhall be taken away; then ſhall the wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to their greater grief and confuſion the difference betwixt that eternal and chief good, and the frail and tranſitory pleaſures of this life. If St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays this of the loſs of the reward of eternal happineſs, that it is a greater evil, than the torment of hell fire: what ſhall the loſs of God be, not onely as our Good, but alſo for as much that in himſelf he is the chief Good, of which the damned are to be deprived for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this condemnation of a Sinner unto the loſs of God, and all which is good, ſhall extend ſo far, that he ſhall be deprived even of the hope of what is good, and ſhall be left for ever in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found poverty and neceſſity, without expectation of remedy or relief. What greater want can any one have, than to want all things, and even hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any thing? We are amazed at the poverty of holy <hi>Job,</hi> who from a Prince and a rich man came to lye upon a dunghil, having nothing left but a piece of a broken pot to ſcrape away the putrifaction from his ſores. But even this ſhall fail the damned, who would take it for a great Regalo to have a dunghil for their bed inſtead of the burning coals of that eternal fire. Neither ſhall they be Maſters ſo much as of that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pot, wherein to contain a little water, if it might be given them.<note place="margin">

That rich Glutton in the Goſpel, accuſtomed to drink in Cups of Chryſtal, to eat in Silver, and to be cloathed in Silks and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Linnens, can tell us how far this infernal poverty

This rich and nice Glutton came to ſuch an extremity, that he would eſteem it a great felicity, that they would give him but one drop of water, although it were from the filthy and loathſome finger of a Leper; and yet this alſo was wanting unto him. Let the rich of the World ſee to what poverty they are like to come, if they truſt in ther riches; let them know that they ſhall be condemned to the loſs of all which is good. Let them reflect upon him, who was accuſtomed to be cloathed in precious Garments, to tread upon Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, to ſleep upon Down, to dwell in ſpacious Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, now naked thrown upon burning coals, and packt up in ſome narrow corner of that infernal Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.

                     <p>This poverty or want of all good of the damned is accompanied with a moſt opprobrious infamy and diſhonour, when by publick ſentence they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for their enormous offences of eternal glory, and reprehended in the preſence of Saints and Angels by the Lord of Heaven and Earth. This infamy ſhall be ſo great, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of it in theſe words. <q>A moſt intolerable thing is Hell,<note place="margin">Chryſ. in Math. <hi>24.</hi>
                           </note> and moſt horrible are the torments; yet if me ſhould place a thouſand Hells before me, nothing could be ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible unto me, as to be excluded from the honour of glory, to be hated of Chriſt, and to hear from him theſe words, I know you not.</q> This infamy we may in ſome ſort declare under the example of a mighty King, who having no Heir to ſucceed him in his Kingdom took up a beautiful Boy at the Church door, and nouriſhed him as his Son, and in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:51068:219"/>commanded, that if at ripe years his conditions were vertuous and ſutable to his calling, he ſhould be received as lawful King, and ſeated in his Royal Throne; but if he proved vitious and unfit for Government, they ſhould puniſh him with infamy, and ſend him to the Gallies. The Kingdom obeyed this Command, provided him excellent Maſters and Tutors; but he became ſo untoward and ill-inclined, that he would learn nothing, flung away his books, ſpent his time amongſt other Boyes in making houſes of dirt, and other childiſh fooleries: for which his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors corrected and chaſtiſed him, and adviſed him of what was fitting and moſt imported him; but all did no good: onely when they reprehended him, he could weep, not becauſe he repented, but becauſe they hindred his ſport: and the next day did the ſame. The more he grew in age, the worſe he became; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they informed him of the Kings Teſtament, and what behooved him, all was to no purpoſe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt after all poſſible care and diligence his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the whole Kingdom weary of his ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a publick Aſſembly declared him unworthy to raign, diſpoiled him of his Royal Ornaments, and condemned him with infamy unto the Gallies. What greater affront and ignominy can there be, than this, to loſe a Kingdom, and to be made a Gally-ſlave? for I do not know which of theſe things that young man would be more ſenſible of. More ignominious and a more lamentable Tragedy is that of a Chriſtian condemned to Hell, who was taken by God from the gates of death, adopted his Son, with condition that, if he kept his Commandments, he ſhould raign in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and if not, he ſhould be condemned to Hell. Yet he forgetting theſe obligations without reſpect of his Tutors and Maſters, who were the holy Angels, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Angel Guardian, who failed not to inſtill into him holy inſpirations, and other learned and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men, who exhorted him both by their doctrine
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:51068:219"/>and example what was fitting for a Child of God; But he neither moved by their advices, nor the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of Heaven, by which God overthrew his vain intentions, and thwarted his unlawful pleaſures, onely lamented his temporal loſſes, and not his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and at the time of his death was ſentenced to be deprived of the Kingdom of Heaven, and precipitated into Hell. What infamy can be greater than this of the damned Soul? for if it be a great infamy to ſuffer death by Humane Juſtice for ſome crimes committed, how great an infamy will it be to be condemned by Divine Juſtice for a Traitor and perfidious Rebel to God? Beſides this bitterneſs of pains the damned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall alſo be eternally branded with the infamy of their offences; ſo as they ſhall be ſcorned and ſcoft at by the Devils themſelves, and not onely Devils, but all rational creatures; Men and Angels ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt them, as infamous and wicked Traitors to their King, God, and Redeemer.<note place="margin">Jſai. <hi>13.</hi> Facies combuſtae vultus eorum.</note> And as fugitive Slaves are marked and cauterized with burning irons, ſo this infamy by ſome ſpecial mark of uglineſs and deformity ſhall be ſtamped upon their faces, and bodies; ſo as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ſayes; ſo ignominious ſhall be the body of a Sinner, that when his Soul returns to enter it, it ſhall be amazed to behold it ſo horrible, and ſhall wiſh it were rather in the ſame ſtate, as when it was half eaten up by worms.</p>

                  <p>ANother kind of puniſhment of great diſcomfort and affliction is that of Exile, which the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhall ſuffer in the higheſt degree. For they ſhall be baniſhed into the profound bowels of the Earth, a place moſt remote from Heaven, and the moſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous of all others, where they ſhall neither ſee the Sun by day, nor the Stars by night, where all ſhall be horror and darkneſs; and therefore it was ſaid of that condemned perſon, Caſt him forth into utter darkneſs, forth of the City of God, forth of the Heavens, forth of this World, where he may never more appear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that land, which is called in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> A dark land,<note place="margin">

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:51068:220"/>which are many: ſo from many things they ſhould receive their affliction. Into this Sewer and Sink of all the Elements, into this land of puniſhment and torments ſhall be baniſhed the enemies of God.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhment of Exile was moſt grievous unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, when for ſome enormous fault they were caſt forth of the City, and baniſhed into ſome deſolate Iſland or barbarous Nation. <hi>Ovid,</hi> when he was ſent into <hi>Pontus,</hi> did not ceaſe from lamenting his misfortune, ſtill ſighing after his own Country.

What a grief ſhall it be to ſee themſelves deprived of the Palaces of Heaven, the ſociety of Saints, and that happy Country of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, where all is peace, quietneſs, charity, and joy, where all ſhines, all pleaſes, and all parts reſound with Alleluja's? <hi>David</hi> being abſent from his Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt barbarous Nations, although his life were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his baniſhment, yet could not chooſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as his death. And the People of <hi>Juda,</hi> whilſt they remained in <hi>Babylon,</hi> thought it impoſſible for them to ſing (being an action of mirth) whileſt they were in a ſtrange Country. Certainly if the Damned had no other puniſhment, than to ſee themſelves baniſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Devils into a place far diſtant from Heaven, ſad as night, without the ſight or comfort of Sun or Moon for all eternity, it were a torment unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

How grievous is the baniſhment into that place, where none wiſhes well unto another: where the Fathers hate their Sons, and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:51068:221"/>the Sons abhorre their Fathers? This may appear by this example, which is rehearſed in the lives of the Ancient Fathers of the Deſert. A Son of an Uſurer being converted to penance by a Sermon, wherein that vice was reprehended, begged of his Father and of another Brother of his, that forſaking that infamous vice they would reſtore all that they had unlawfully gained. They not hearkning to him, but, as they uſe to ſay, being deaf of that ear, he retired into the Wilderneſs, and became a Monk in company of other Servants of Almighty God. His Father and Brother died without repentance of their ſins. The holy Monk was much afflicted for the miſerable condition he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were in, and begged earneſtly of Almighty God, he would pleaſe to reveal unto him their ſtate and condition. Being one day perſiſting in this prayer, an Angel appeared unto him, and taking him by the hand, carried him to the top of a high Mountain, from whence he diſcovered a deep valley full of fire, whence having firſt heard a fearful cry, he preſently ſaw his Father, who boiled in the fire like a pea in a boiling pot, and his Brother ſwimming as it were in the flames now above, and now below. The Son ſpake unto his Father, ſaying: Curſed be thou (Father) for all eternity, becauſe by an unjuſt inheritance thou haſt been the cauſe of my damnation. And the Father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him: Curſed be thou, Son; for to the end I might leave thee a rich Inheritance, I ſtuck not to gain it by unjuſt means. They diſappeared, and the Monk much aſtoniſhed returned home to his Monaſtery, where he lived in very rigorous penance till death. In other baniſhments, when Parents or Friends meet in a Country far from home, they endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another, and even enemies are then reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But in this baniſhment of Hell friends abhorre Friends, and Parents hate, and are hated by their Children.</p>

                     <p>To this may be added, that in this baniſhment of the Damned the exiles are not allowed the liberty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baniſhed perſons, who within the Iſle or Region of relegation may goe or move whither they pleaſe: but not ſo the Damned in Hell; becauſe the place of their exile is alſo a Priſon, that ſo this grievous ſort of puniſhment may be alſo added to their other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Then they compaſſed them about with fire, to the end that ſtanding ſtill they might be burnt alive: and if they ſtirred, the ſharp points pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their fleſh with more intolerable pains than the fire. What ſhall then be that torment of the Damned, where they ſhall eternally burn without dying, and without poſſibility of removing from the place deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? where whatſoever they touch ſhall be fire and ſulphur; into which their bodies ſhall at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day be plunged, as their ſouls at preſent ſwim in the middle of that lake or pond of fire, (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls it) like fiſhes in the Sea, which enters into their very ſubſtance more than the water into the mouth, noſe, and ears of him who is drowned.</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhall unſavoury ſmells, ſo proper unto Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be wanting in that infernal Dungeon. For firſt that fire of ſulphur being pent in without vent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration ſhall ſend forth a moſt poiſonous ſent; and if a match of brimſtone be ſo offenſive here, what ſhall ſuch a maſs of that ſtuffe be in Hell? Secondly, the bodies of the damned ſhall caſt forth a moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtench of themſelves, and that more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quality of their ſins. It happened in <hi>Lions</hi> that a Sexton entring into a certain Vault, where the body of a man not long before dead lay yet uncovered, there iſſued forth ſo peſtilential, a ſmell, that the dead man killed the living. If one mans body then cauſe ſuch a ſtink, what ſhall proceed from a million of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which, though alive for their further evil, yet are dead in the ſecond death? beſides (as hath been ſaid) all the uncleanneſs and filth of the World, when it is purified, muſt fall into that eternal Sink, which ſhall infinitely encreaſe this noiſome quality. <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> writes, that the Enemy of mankind <hi>Actiolinus</hi> the Tyrant had many Priſons full of torments, miſery, and ill ſmells: inſomuch as men took it for a happineſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die, than to be impriſoned: becauſe being load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with irons, afflicted with hunger, and poiſoned

In this want of room they had not place to comply with the neceſſities of nature, but were forced to eaſe themſelves where they ſtood, which cauſed ſo horrid a ſavour, as exceeded all the reſt of their afflictions. One time (ſaith the Author) giving a good ſumme of money to the Moors, we had leave, whileſt the <hi>Vandals</hi> ſlept, to ſee them, and at our entrance ſunk up to the knees in that filth and loathſomneſs.

                     <p>If one were caſt into ſome deep dongeon, without cloathes, expoſed to the inclemency of the cold and moyſture of the place, where he ſhould not ſee the light of Heaven, ſhould have nothing to feed on but once a day ſome little peece of hard barley bread, and that he were to continue there ſix yeares without ſpeaking or ſeeing of any body, and not to ſleep on other bed but the cold ground, what a miſery were this? one
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:51068:223"/>week of that habitation would appeare longer than a hundred years. Yet compare this with what ſhall be in that baniſhment and priſon of Hell, and you ſhall finde the miſerable life of that man to be a happineſs. There in all his troubles he ſhould not meet with any to ſcoff and jeſt at his misfortunes, none to torment and whip him; but in Hell he ſhall finde both. The Devils ſhall not ceaſe to deride, whip, and cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him. There ſhould be no horrid fights, no feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noyſes of howlings, groanings and lamentations. In hell the eyes and eares of the damned ſhall never be free from ſuch affrights. There ſhould be no flames of fire to ſcorch him. In hell they ſhall burn into his very bowels. There he might move and walk. In hell not ſtirr a foot. There he may breath the ayr without ſtink. In hell he ſhall ſuck in nothing but flames, ſtink, and ſulphur. There he might hope for coming forth. In hell there is no remedy, no redemption. There that little peece of hard bread would every day ſeem a dainty. But in hell in Millions of yeares his eyes ſhall not behold a crum of bread, nor a drop of water, but he ſhall eternally rage with a dog-like hunger, and a burning thirſt. This is to be the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of that Land of darkneſs: barren of all things, but of the brambles and thorns of grief and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <p>ANother grievous Puniſhment amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was that of Servitude or Slavery, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe, who for ſome great and hainous offences were condemned as Slaves, not to the ſervice of any
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:51068:224"/>particular perſon, but to undergoe ſuch and ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: and were therefore called <hi>Slaves of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> This miſerable ſlavery is that which the damned are to ſuffer in Hell, who are condemned to be eternally Slaves of pains and torments, and of their Miniſters and Hangmen, the Devils. Thoſe Slaves the <hi>Romans</hi> eſteemed worſe than the dead.<note place="margin">Cuiac. Obſerv. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> For, beſides the loſs of liberty, (which is next to that of life,) their condition was moſt infamous, and their life moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Yet in reſpect of the ſlavery of the damned, who are ſubjected to their pains with all their ſenſes and powers both of ſoul and body, it might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted free and glorious. With their touch they are to ſerve that burning and never conſuming Fire: with their taſte Hunger and Thirſt: with their ſmell Stink: with their ſight thoſe horrid and monſtrous a Shapes, which the Devils ſhall aſſume: with their hearing Scorns and Affronts: with their imagination Horror: with their will Loathſomneſs and Deteſtation: with their memory Deſpair: with their underſtanding Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with ſuch a multitude of other puniſhments, as they ſhall want eyes to weep for them.<note place="margin">Aelianus lib. <hi>14.</hi> C. <hi>22.</hi>

                     <hi>Aelianus</hi> writes of <hi>Trizus</hi> the Tyrant, that he commanded his Subjects not to ſpeak together: and when they uſed ſignes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of words, he alſo forbad thoſe. Whereupon the afflicted people met in the Market-place at leaſt to weep for their misfortunes. But neither was that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Greater ſhall be the rigour in Hell, where they ſhall neither be ſuffered to ſpeak word of comfort, nor move hand or foot, nor eaſe their hearts with weeping; neither, if all the pores of their bodies, or hairs of their heads were turned into eyes, would they ſuffice to do it. <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Prophet lamented with floods of tears, that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was the Queen of Nations, ſhould be made a Slave and tributary. What tears are ſufficient to lament the damnation of a Chriſtian, who from an Heir and Prince of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven hath made himſelf a Slave to the Devil
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:51068:224"/>and thoſe eternal puniſhments of Hell, unto which he is to pay as many tributes, as he hath ſenſes, powers, and members? Let us mark how great is the tyranny of the Devil, even over thoſe, who are not his ſlaves. What rigour and puniſhments hath he exerciſed upon thoſe, who are the ſervants of God? what will he do then upon his own Slaves and Captives? We will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (paſſing over others) inſtance in one related by holy Scripture. Let us behold in what grievous manner (having demanded licence from God) the Devil affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted holy <hi>Job,</hi> making him from head to foot but one ſore, ſo loathſome and infected, that lying upon a Dunghil he ſcrapt away the worms and corruption of his wounds with a potſheard: ſo lean, that onely ſo much fleſh remained about the lips of his mouth, as might enable him to ſpeak and anſwer. The night, which uſes to be a refreſhment and eaſe unto the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of others, increaſed his pains with viſions and phantaſms. In concluſion his Wife could not endure the noiſomneſs of his putrified body: and his three Friends, who came to viſit and comfort him, were ſo amazed at his affliction, that in ſeaven dayes they could not ſpeak unto him. From whence we may draw two moſt important arguments. The firſt, That if God permitted the Devil ſo to handle the ſimplicity, piety, obedience, purity, and ſanctity of <hi>Job,</hi> onely to prove him, to convince the Devil, and leave us an example of patience, How will he ſuffer the Devil to deal with the doubleneſs, craſty boldneſs, impudence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of others, who ſhall be condemned into Hell fire? The ſecond, If the Devils tormenting him, even until he became a Leper, and the moſt loathſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle that the world ever looked upon, the Scripture only ſayes, That God touched him, attributing to God what the Devil did, as we attribute unto the Judge the torments executed by the Hangmen: when God ſhall then diſcharge his whole wrath upon a ſlave in Hell, what whips, what torments ſhall fall upon him?</p>

                  <p>Let us now come unto the puniſhment of Whipping, under which is underſtood all chaſtiſement of pain executed upon evill doers. This was ſignifyed unto the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi>

For as the ſlaves of the earth are whipt and puniſht by their maſters, ſo the ſlaves of hell are tormented by the Devills, who have power and dominion over them. And even as ſlaves are whipped and chaſtized by their Maſters, ſo the Torments, treating the damned as their ſlaves, lay upon them a thouſand afflictions, griefs, and miſeries. But who ſhall be able to expreſs the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and greatneſs of their torments, ſince all their powers and ſenſes, ſoul and body are to ſuffer in a moſt violent manner? And every member of their body ſhall ſuffer greater pain and torment, then if it were torn from the body. If one can not tell how to ſuffer a tooth-ach, head-ach, pain in the eare, or the pain of the chollick, what will it be, when there ſhall not be any joynt, or the leaſt part in the body, which ſhall not cauſe him a moſt intenſe pain: not onely the head, or teeth, but alſo the breaſts, the ſide, ſhoulders; the back, the heart, thighs, the knees, the feet,

                     <p>Beſides this, every ſenſe from his particular object ſhall receive a particular puniſhment. The eyes ſhall not be onely grieved with a ſcorching heat, which ſhall burn their very pupils, but ſhall be tormented with monſtrous and horrible figures. Many have loſt their wits through fear of ſuch apparitions, and ſome their lives. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> explicating the 90. Pſalm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that a certain religious perſon being ready to die beheld two Devils in that horrid and ugly ſhape, that he cried out as if he had been diſtracted, Curſed be the hour that I entred into Religion; and then holding his peace, not long after with a quiet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed voice and countenance he ſaid; Nay rather bleſſed be the time that I became of this Order; and ever bleſſed be the Mother of Chriſt, whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes loved from my heart; And then turning to thoſe who were in prayer, he ſaid unto them, Marvel not at the turbation of my ſpirit, for two Devils appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me in that monſtrous and horrid form, that if there were here a fire of ſulphur and melted met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which were to laſt unto the day of Judgement, I would ſooner paſs through the middeſt of it, than turn again to behold them. If then two Devils cauſed ſuch amazement, what ſhall the ſight of legions doe, each exceeding other in deformity? If the Devil be ſo ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and terrible in this life, what ſhall he be in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of damnation, and eſpecially ſo many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Many are affrighted very much paſſing onely through a Church-yard, onely for fear of ſeeing a phantaſm; in what a fright will be a miſerable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoul, which ſhall ſee ſo many, and of ſo horrid ſhapes? St, <hi>Gregory</hi> reflecting on that which is ſpoken in the book of <hi>Job,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:51068:226"/>horror, ſayes in this manner; How can there be fear, where there is ſo much grief? We grieve for a preſent evil, and fear for that, which is to come: and he who is arrived at the utmoſt of miſery hath nothing more to fear; and not to fear is a kind of good: and no good can happen in Hell. He anſwers, That as death perpetually killing the damned leaves them alive, that they may die living, ſo pain torments them, and in ſuch manner affrights them, that they are ſtill in fear of greater ſucceeding pains. Their fight alſo ſhall be tormented with beholding the puniſhment of their friends and kindred. <hi>Egeſippus</hi> writes that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Hircanus</hi> reſolving to puniſh certain perſons with exemplary rigour, cauſed 800 to be crucified; and whileſt they were yet alive; cauſed their wives and children to be murthered before their eyes, that ſo they might die not one but many deaths. This rigour ſhall not be wanting in Hell, where Fathers ſhall ſee their Sons, and Brothers their Brothers tormented. The Torment of the eyes ſhall be alſo very great, in regard that thoſe, that have given others ſcandal, and made others fall into ſin, ſhall ſee themſelves and thoſe others in that Abyſs of torments. To the ſight of theſe dreadful and grievous apparitions ſhall be added that nocturnal horrour and fearful darkneſs of the place. <hi>Nicholas de Lira</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">In Exod. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note> ſayes, that therefore the darkneſs of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was ſaid to be horrible, becauſe there the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> beheld fearful figures and phantaſms, which terrified them. In the like manner in that infernal darkneſs the eyes ſhall be tormented with the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and enormous figures of the wicked ſpirits; which ſhall appear much more dreadful by reaſon of the obſcurity and ſadneſs of that eternal night.</p>
                     <p>The Hearing ſhall not onely be afflicted by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pain cauſed by that ever burning and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating fire, but alſo with the fearful and amazing noiſes of thunders, roarings, howlings, clamours, groans, curſes, and blaſphemies. <hi>Sylla</hi> being Dictator
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:51068:226"/>cauſed ſix thouſand perſons to be encloſed in the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and then appointing the Senate to meet in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cloſe by, where he intended to ſpeak unto them about his own affairs, to ſtrike the greater terror into them, and make them know he was their Maſter, he gave order, that ſo ſoon as he began his oration, the Souldiers ſhould kill this multitude of people, which was effected. Upon which were heard ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, outcries, groans, claſhing of Armour, and blows of thoſe mercileſs homicides, that the Senatours could not hear a word, but ſtood amazed with terror of ſo horrid a fact. Such ſhall be the harmony of Hell, when the ears ſhall be deafned with the cries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the damned. What confuſion and horrour ſhall it breed to hear all lament, all complain, all curſe and blaſpheme through the bitterneſs of the torments, which they ſuffer?<note place="margin">Sur. in ejus vita, <hi>14.</hi> Apr.</note> St. <hi>Lidwin</hi> being in an extaſie ſaw a place ſo dreadful made of black ſtone, and of ſuch a depth, that it would fright one to look into it. The Saint heard there within moſt fearful groans, cries, and howlings, noiſe, and horrible knocking as it were of hammers, wherewith thoſe within were tormented. She was ſo aſtoniſhed to hear this, that if all the noiſe and lamentations of the world were joyned together, it would be of no trouble in reſpect of it. The Angel told her, That was the habitation of the damned. And demanding of her, whither ſhe had any deſire to ſee it: ſhe ſaid, No, ſhe would not ſee it, becauſe only hearing what there was done, cauſed her an unſufferable grief.</p>
                     <p>The Smell alſo ſhall be tormented with a moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential ſtench. Horrible was that torment uſed by <hi>Mezentius,</hi> to tye a living body to a dead, and there to leave them until the infection and putrified exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the dead had killed the living. What can be more abominable, than for a living man to have his mouth laid cloſe to that of a dead one, full of grubs and worms: where the living muſt receive all thoſe peſtilential vapours breathed forth from a corrupted
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:51068:227"/>carcaſs, and ſuffer ſuch loathſomneſs, and abominable ſteneh? But what is this in reſpect of Hell: when each body of the damned is more loathſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury than a million of dead dogs, and all theſe preſſed and crowded together in ſo ſtreight a compaſs? <hi>Iſaias</hi> in reſpect of their ſtench calls them dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">

Neither ſhall the Devils ſend forth a better ſmell. For although they are ſpirits, yet thoſe fiery bodies, unto which they are faſtned and confined, ſhall be of a moſt peſtilential ſavour. And in this manner a Devil, who had appeared unto him, being put to flight by St. <hi>Martin,</hi> left ſuch an horrible ſtench behind him, that the Saint deemed himſelf to be already in hell, and ſaid unto himſelf: If one onely Devil having been here hath cauſed this, what will all the Devils together, and damned men doe?<note place="margin">Libel. de provid. num. <hi>3.</hi>

Some years after this man fell grievouſly ſick of a diſeaſe, that brought him to the point of death; and being now dead in all mens judgement, his ſoul was caſt into a ſea of fire, where he remained ſuffering until ſuch time as an Angel of Heaven came unto him, and ſaid, Behold what they are to ſuffer, that ſerve the Devil. But if ſo great a mercy ſhould be ſhewed unto thee, as to grant thee longer life, wouldſt thou not ſpend it in doing penance for thy ſins? He reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, There can be nothing ſo hard or painful, which I would not undergoe to eſcape this torment. Then the Lord uſed that mercy to him, as to let him return to the uſe of life and ſenſes, and riſing off the Biere, where he was already placed to be carried to burial, all that were preſent were aſtoniſhed at him: who at the ſame inſtant began a courſe of life of moſt auſtere and

Now what a miſerable unhappineſs will it be to burn in thoſe flames of Hell not onely for one hour, but till the day of Judgement, yea even for all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and world without end? Who would not eſteem it an hideous torment, if he were to be burnt alive an hundred times, and his torment were to laſt every time for an hours ſpace? with what compaſſionate eyes would all the world look upon ſuch a miſerable wretch?

                        </note> Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> doth alſo write of one, to whom the pains and torments, as alſo the joyes and bliſs of the other life were ſhewn: and having obtained leave to return to this world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he renounced all he had in this life, and betook himſelf unto a Monaſtery, where he perſevered in a moſt rigid manner of life to his dying day: in ſo much that his manner of living gave perpetual teſtimony, that, although he was ſilent, yet he had ſeen horrible things, and that he had hopes to obtain other great ones, which did indeed deſerve to be thirſted after. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a frozen River, which was near the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent without putting off his cloathes, having firſt broke the ice in ſeveral places, that he might be able to get into the water; and afterwards let his cloathes to dry upon his back. Some admired, that a man's body was able to ſuffer ſo great cold in the Winter time; And to thoſe, who demanded, How he could poſſibly endure it: He replyed, I have ſeen colds far greater. And when they ſaid unto him: How can you ſo conſtantly keep ſuch a rigorous and auſtere manner of life? He replied, I have ſeen far greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. Neither did he relent in the rigour of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance even in his decrepit age: but was very careful to chaſtiſe his fleſh with continual faſts; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar converſation and wholſome admonitions were ſuch, as he did much good to many, and efficaciouſly ſtirred them up to the amendment of their lives.</p>
                     <p>We muſt make uſe of this ſelf-ſame conſideration to encourage our ſelves to ſuffer in this life all that can be ſuffered, in regard that in the other we ſhould ſuffer more than can be ſuffered. Hell certainly is more unſufferable than faſting with bread and water: farre more than a rough hair-cloth, or a diſcipline though never ſo bloody: far more than the greateſt injuries or diſgraces, that can be put upon us. Let us then ſuffer that which is leſſer to be freed from that which is
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:51068:229"/>greater; eſpecially being ſo much greater, by how much a living creature exceeds a painted one. Let us not complain of any thing that may happen unto us in this life: But let us rather be comforted, that we, who have deſerved to be in thoſe eternal flames with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profit or hope of reward, may by our patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering here ſome temporal afflictions expect an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward for them in Heaven.

                        </note> and disfigured with leanneſs. But the Saint could find in this entertainment a ſharp croſs, which was, that entring into the Bath alone, ſhe went to the Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where the water came out in a manner boyling hot, and there ſuffered her ſelf to be ſcalded to that degree, that it ſeemed impoſſible for a weak Damſel to have been able to endure it. Her Confeſſarius asked her afterwards, How ſhe had ſo much courage to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſuch heat, and for ſo long a ſpace? She replyed, That when ſhe placed her ſelf there, ſhe alſo placed her conſideration in the pains of Purgatory and Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and withall begged of God Almighty, whom ſhe had offended, that he would be pleaſed to change the puniſhments ſhe had deſerved by her ſins into tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pains and ſufferings: whereby all the pains of this life ſeemed very eaſie unto her to ſuffer, and the great heat of the ſcalding water of the Bath ſeemed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to her in reſpect of the fiery Furnace of Hell, in which the damned are for ever and ever to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>

                        </note> I will here rehearſe a ſtory out of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Demianus,</hi> which will give us to underſtand the terribleneſs of this torment. In <hi>Lombardy</hi> (ſaith he) there was a man cunning and crafty, of a notable talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue, and a friend of breaking jeſts on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and commonly by reaſon of his quick wit he came off with credit; And if at any time it happened
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:51068:230"/>to him otherwayes, he knew how to put it off very handſomely. In fine he was one of thoſe that knew very well how to live in the world. But what end had all his tricks and ſlights? he died; for againſt this ſtroak he had no defence. His body was buried in the Church, and his ſoul in the place, which God grant no body may ever come in. An holy Religious man being in prayer he ſaw in ſpirit a great Lake, not of water, but of fire, which boiled like a Pot, and caſt flames now and then up into the heavens, which ſent forth ſparks in ſo great quantity, and with ſuch fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe, that it cauſed great horrour to hear and ſee it. What would it be to ſuffer it? The miſerable foul of this man we ſpeak of did ſuffer it in all extremity. Moreover he ſaw that the Lake was encompaſſed round about with fearful Serpents and terrible Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, which had their mouths open towards the Lake, with many rows of ſharp teeth to guard the Lake. In this confuſion of fire and cruel beaſts the Soul of the miſerable Babler was howling and crying, and ſwimming upon the flames endeavoured to get to the banck, and drawing nigh, the comfort he found was, that a Serpent ſtretching out a long neck and a wide mouth was ready to tear him in pieces and ſwallow him; He endeavoured to turn another way in the Lake, and drawing near the ſide he lighted upon a Dragon, the onely ſight whereof made him make more haſte back again, than he had done to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He ſwam in the Lake burning alive: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, he found the like encounter; but which is worſe, he ſhall remain there whileſt God is God, without any remedy at all. And with much reaſon, ſaith St. <hi>Peter Damianus,</hi> he ſuffered this puniſhment of not being able to get out of that Lake of fire, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he in this life got ſo cunningly out of any adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by his many ſhifts. In this manner God Almighty gave to underſtand by this revelation the extremity of this torment. But it is to be noted, that it is farre
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:51068:230"/>greater than is here expreſſed; becauſe this was not ſo much to tell us what hell is, as to declare by ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or repreſentation, which may remain fixt in our ſenſes, that, which indeed exceeds all ſimilitude or reſemblance.</p>

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:51068:231"/>torments, preſerving onely life that the pain of death may live eternally? And if we ſee ſome timorous people with an imaginary fear tremble and remain half dead, there is no doubt but the imagination of thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons joyned with the horror of the place, where they are, will cauſe a thouſand pains and torments.</p>

And if joy conſiſts in the poſſeſſing of what one loves, and pain in the want of that which is deſired, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſitated to what is abhorred, What greater pain and torment than to be ever deſiring that which ſhall never be enjoyed, and ever abhorring that which we can, never be quyt of?<note place="margin">Bern. l. <hi>5.</hi> de Conſid. ad Eugen.

                     </p>
                     <p>This rage and madneſs ſhall be augmented by the deſpair, which ſhall be joyned unto it. For as no man ſins without injury to the Divine mercy, preſuming to ſin in, hope he may repent and be pardoned: So it was fit that the Divine juſtice ſhould chaſtiſe the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a deſpair of all remedy, that ſo he, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Divine benefits with a falſe hope, might feel the puniſhment of a true deſpair. This torment ſhall be moſt terrible unto the damned. For as the greateſt evil is eaſed by hope, ſo the leaſt is made grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous by deſpair. Hope in afflictions is ſupported by two things; One is the fruit, which may reſult from
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:51068:231"/>ſuffering; The other is the end and concluſion of the evil ſuffered. But in regard the deſpair of the damned is of ſo great evils, the deſpair it ſelf will be a moſt terrible one. If one ſuffers and reaps fruit from it, 'tis a comfort unto him, and the grief is recompenced by the joy of the benefit thereof; but when the ſuffering is without fruit or profit, then it comes to be heavy indeed. The hope of a good harveſt makes the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with chearfulneſs endure the toyl of plowing and ſowing; but if he were certain to reap no profit, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pace he moved would be grievous and irkſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. A Day-labourer with the hope of his wages goes through the toyl of the day with great comfort: But if they commanded him to work for nothing, he would have no heart to work at all. The holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors of Chriſt, what penances, what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours, what martyrdomes have they willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, expecting the fruit they were to draw from their patience? And though in temporal afflictions this hope of recompence ſhould fail, yet the hope, that they would ſometime ceaſe and have an end, would afford ſome comfort and eaſe unto the ſufferers. But in Hell both thoſe are wanting; The damned ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive reward for their ſufferings, nor ſhall their torments ever have an end. Of them it is that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>They ſhall ſeek death, and ſhall not find it;</hi>

One penitent knock upon the breaſt here may gain eternal glory; There the moſt intenſe pains and torments both in ſoul and body cannot deſerve a drop of cold water, nor ſo much eaſe, as to turn from one ſide to the other. In this raging deſpair ends the temerarious hopes of ſinners. Hell is full of thoſe, who hoped they ſhould never enter into it: and full of thoſe, who deſpair of getting out of it. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:51068:232"/>with a preſumptuous hope they ſhould not die in ſin: and that proving falſe, are fallen into eternal deſperation. There is no hope can excuſe the falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great a danger. Let us therefore ſecure Heaven, and not ſin.</p>
                     <p>The Memory ſhall be another cruel Tormentor of thoſe miſerable ſinners, converting all they have done good or bad into torments: The good, becauſe they have loſt their reward, The bad, becauſe they have deſerved their puniſhments. The delights alſo, which they have enjoyed, and all the happineſs of this life, in which they have triumphed, (ſeeing that for them they fell into this miſery,) ſhall be a ſharp ſword, which ſhall pierce their hearts. They ſhall burſt with grief, when they ſhall compare the ſhortneſs of their paſt pleaſures with the eternity of their preſent torments. What Mathematician ſo learned, as can perfectly ſet out the exceſs of thoſe eternal years of the other life unto thoſe ſhort few and evil dayes of this? What groans, what ſighs will they pour out, when they ſee that thoſe delights have hardly laſted an inſtant, and that the pains they ſuffer for them ſhall laſt for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and eternities, all that is paſt appearing but as a dream? Let us tremble now at the felicity of this life, if it make ſuch wounds in the hearts of thoſe, who have uſed it ill. Let us tremble at all our pleaſures, ſince they may turn into Arſeneck and Hemlock. The miſerable wretch ſhall with great grief remember how often he might have gained Heaven, and did it not, but is now tumbled into Hell, and ſhall ſay unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, How many times might I have prayed, and ſpent that time in play? but now I pay for it. How many times ought I to have faſted, and left it to ſatisfie my greedy appetite? How many times might I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alms, and ſpent it in ſin? How many times might I have pardoned my enemies, and choſe rather to be revenged? How many times might I have frequented the Sacraments, and forbore them, becauſe I would
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:51068:232"/>not quit the occaſion of ſinning? There never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted means of ſerving God: but I never made uſe of it, and am therefore now juſtly paid for all. Behold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Caitiff, that entertaining thy ſelf in pleaſures, thou haſt for toyes and fooleries loſt Heaven. If thou wouldeſt, thou mighteſt have been a companion for Angels; if thou wouldeſt thou mighteſt have been in eternal joy: and thou haſt loſt all for the pleaſure of a moment. O accurſed and wretched fool, thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer courted thee with Heaven, and thou deſpiſedſt him for a baſe trifle. This was thy fault, and now thou ſuffereſt for it; and ſince thou wouldeſt not be happy with God, thou ſhalt now be eternally curſed by him and his Angels.</p>
                     <p>The Underſtanding ſhall torment it ſelf with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of great bitterneſs, diſcourſing of nothing but what may grieve it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhall not there take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his wiſdom, nor <hi>Seneca</hi> comfort himſelf with his Philoſophy. <hi>Galen</hi> ſhall find no remedy in his Phyſick, nor the profoundeſt Scholar in his Divinity. A certain Doctor of <hi>Paris</hi> appeared after death unto the Biſhop of that City, and gave him an account that he was damned. The Biſhop demanded of him, if he had there any knowledge. He anſwered, That he knew nothing but onely three things; The firſt, that he was eternally damned: The ſecond, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt againſt him was irrevocable: The third, that for the vain pleaſure of the world he was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the viſion of God. And then he deſired to know of the Biſhop if there were any people in the world remaining. The Biſhop asking him the reaſon of that queſtion, he anſwered, that within theſe few laſt dayes there have ſo many ſouls deſcended into Hell, that me-thinks there ſhould not any be left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth.</p>
                     <p>In this power of the Soul is engendered tho worm of conſcience, which is ſo often propoſed unto us in holy Scripture as a moſt terrible torment, and greater
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:51068:233"/>than that of fire. Onely in one Sermon, or rather in the Epilogue of that Sermon Chriſt our Redeemer three times menaces us with that Worm,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Marc.</hi> 9.</note> which gnaws the conſciences and tears in pieces the hearts of the Damned, admoniſhing us as often, That their worm ſhall never die, nor their ſire be quenched. For as the worm, which breeds in dead fleſh, or that which breeds in wood, eats and gnaws that ſubſtance of which they are engendered; ſo the Worm, which is bred from ſin, is in perpetual enmity with it, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring the heart of the ſinner with raging, deſperate, and now unprofitable grief: ſtill putting him in mind, that by his own fault he loſt that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory, which he might ſo eaſily have obtained, and is now fallen into eternal torments, from whence there is no redemption. And certainly this reſentment of the loſs of Heaven ſhall more torment him, than the fire of Hell. Of an evil conſcience even in this life St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. <hi>45.</hi> Quint. Declam. <hi>12.</hi> Senec. ep. <hi>97.</hi>
                        </note> that amongſt all the tribulations of the Soul none was greater than that of a guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Even the Gentils knew this, and therefore <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> exclaims, O ſad remembrance and knowledge more grievous than all torments! And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, that evil actions are whipt by the conſcience of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: that perpetual vexation and reſentment brings great afflictions and torments upon the Actors: that wickedneſs drinks up the greateſt part of its own poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is a puniſhment unto it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Certainly it were a great rigour, if a Father ſhould be forced to be preſent at the execution of his Son: but more, if he ſhould be compelled to be the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and yet greater, if the Gallows ſhould be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before his own door, ſo that he could neither go in or out without beholding that affront and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely; but far greater crueltie, if they ſhould make the guilty perſon to execute himſelf, and that by cutting his body in pieces, member after member, or tearing off his fleſh with his own teeth. This is the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:51068:233"/>cruelty and torment of an evil Conſcience, with which a ſinner is racked and tortured amongſt thoſe eternal flames, not being able to baniſh his faults from his memory, nor their puniſhment from his thoughts. The envy alſo, which they ſhall bear towards thoſe, who have gained Heaven by as ſmall matters as they have loſt it, ſhall much add to their grief. Thoſe who are hungry, if they ſee others meaner than they feed at ſome ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and plentiful Table, and cannot be admitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, become more hungry; ſo ſhall it fare with the damned, who ſhall be more afflicted by beholding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſometimes leſs than themſelves, enjoy that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, which they through want of care are deprived of. <hi>Eſau,</hi> though a Clown, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi> had obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Fathers Benediction, cried out and roared like a Lion, and conſumed himſelf with reſentment and horror. What lamentations ſhall thoſe of the damned be, when they ſhall ſee that the Juſt have gained the Benediction of God, not by any deceit or cozenage uſed by them, but that they loſt it through their own neglect? Thoſe who with opinion of merit earneſtly aim at ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Dignity, if at length they ſee themſelves neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with ſhame put off, their grief and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſwells above meaſure: In like manner, I ſay, ſhall it be with thoſe damned wretches, who will be far more afflicted by the conſideration of thoſe great goods and eternal felicities, which they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have loſt, and thoſe to enjoy them, whom they deemed far inferiour to them in merit.

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter all this there ſhall not want in Hell the pains of Death, which amongſt humane puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the greateſt. That of Hell is a living Death, and doth as far exceed this of earth, as the ſubſtance doth a ſhadow. The Death, which men give, together with death takes away the pain and ſenſe of dying; but the Eternal Death of ſinners is with ſenſe and by ſo much greater, as it hath more of life, recollecting within it ſelf the worſt of dying, which is to periſh, and the moſt intolerable, of life, which is to ſuffer pain. And therefore St. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls the pain of the damned a living Death, and a dead Life; and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third an immortal Death. O Death, how much leſs cruel art thou in taking away life, than in forcing to live in ſo painful a manner?<note place="margin">Greg. Moral. l. <hi>9.</hi> c. <hi>49.</hi>
                     </note> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> alſo ſayes: <hi>In hell there ſhall be unto the miſerable a death without death, and an end without end; for their death ſhall ever live, and their end ſhall ever begin.</hi> Mortal ſin is the greateſt of all evils, and conſequently deſerves the greateſt of all puniſhments. Becauſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary death, which takes away the uſe of the ſenſes, the rigour of it is not felt, God ordained another kind of death, in which the ſenſes perpetually dying ſhould perpetually feel the force of pain, and ſhould ever live in the agony of dying. This <hi>David</hi> ſignitied, when he ſaid, That death ſhould feed on the damned; for as the Flock paſtures upon the graſs, but ends it not, becauſe it ſtill grows green and freſh again: ſo that death feeds upon ſinners, but conſumes them not.</p>
                  <p>This death of the damned the holy Scripture calls
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:51068:234"/>the ſecond death, Becauſe it ſucceeds the firſt, and comprehends both that of ſoul and bodie. And with much reaſon may it alſo be called a double death: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death is then doubled when we die, and feel the torment of dying: which in the firſt death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we do not. Even here amongſt us, if there ſhould be a condition, in which we might be ſenſible but of ſome part of that which death brings along with it, it would be eſteemed a greater evil than death it ſelf. Who doubts but if one after burial ſhould find himſelf alive and ſenſible under the earth, where he could ſpeak with no body, ſee nothing but darkneſs, hear nothing but thoſe who walked above him, ſmell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the rotten ſtink of their bodies, cat nothing but his own fleſh, nor feel any thing but the earth which oppreſt him, or the cold pavement of the Vault where he lay: Who doubts not, I ſay, but that this eſtate were worſe than to be wholly dead, ſince life onely ſerved to feel the pain of death? For this reaſon the ingenious <hi>Romans,</hi> when they would puniſh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, which is the greateſt crime, made uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring the offenders alive, as of the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore executed it upon their Veſtal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, when they offended a gainſt their chaſtity, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Oppia</hi> and <hi>Minutia,</hi> that being alive they might feel the pain and bitterneſs of dying. And certainly <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour found this puniſhment ſo bitter, that he devoured his own fleſh by morſels. What Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher is more horrible than that of Hell, what is eternally ſhut upon thoſe who are in it, whore the miſerable damned remain not onely under earth, but under fire, having ſenſe for nothing but to feel death, darkneſs, loathſomneſs, pain and ſtink?

                  <p>Beſides, this death of Hell may be called a double
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:51068:235"/>death, in reſpect it contains both the death of ſin, ang the death of pain: thoſe unfortunate wretches ſtandind condemned never to be freed from the death of ſin, and for ever to be tormented with the death of pain. There is no greater death than that of the Soul, which is ſin, in which the miſerable are to continue whileſt God is God with that infinite evil, and that ugly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which ſin draws along with it, which is worſe than to ſuffer that eternal fire, which is but the puniſhment of it. After ſin, what pain ſhould there be greater than that of ſin it ſelf? and for this reaſon in Hell, in regard 'tis the torment for ſin, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pain than death it ſelf, or the moſt horrible death of all. Who trembles not with the onely memory that he is to die, remembring that he is to ceaſe to be, that the feet, whereon he walks are no more to bear him, that his hands are no more to ſerve him, nor his eyes to ſee? Why then do we not rather tremble at the thought of Hell, in reſpect of which the firſt death is no puniſhment, but a reward, a happineſs, and a joy, there being no damned in Hell, but would take that death, which we here inflict for offences, as an eaſe of his pains? O how much does the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice exceed the humane, ſince that, which men give unto thoſe whom they condemn for the greateſt offences, would be received by thoſe, whom God condemns, as a great eaſe, comfort, and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their deſires, who ſhall deſire death, and death ſhall flye from them? for unto all their evils and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries this as the greateſt is adjoyned, that neither They nor It ſhall ſhall ever die. This circumſtance of being eternal doth much augment the torments of Hell, ſuch being the condition of eternity, (as hath been already declared,) that it doth infinitely aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that, whereunto it is annexed. Let us ſuppoſe that one had but a Gnat, that ſhould ſting his right hand, and a Waſp at the left, and that one foot ſhould be pricked with a Thorn, and the other with a Pin.

What will it then be, when hands, feet, arms, head, bread, and entrails are to burn for all eternity?

To be then plunged into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal flames for years eternal, what underſtanding is there that is able, I do not ſay, to expreſs in words, but to frame a due conception of this torment? That a torment is never to ceaſe, and that the tormented is to live for ever, the onely thinking of it cauſes great horror; What would it be to ſuffer it?<note place="margin">Sur.

                        <hi>Cantipratenſis</hi> writes, That in the parts of <hi>Teutonia</hi> there was a Souldier very valiant, and much given to Tilting and Running at the Ring. And according as he lived, ſo he died miſerably. His Wife, who was a devout perſon, and of exemplar life, after the death of her Husband had in an Extaſie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted unto her the miſerable ſtate of her Husbands Soul. It was repreſented unto her, as if it were ſtill uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Body, encompaſſed with a multitude of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; Whereof the Principal in her hearing gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they ſhould furniſh their new Gueſt with a pair of Shoes fit for his feet, which piercing them might reach to his very head. Then he commanded they ſhould put him on a Coat of Male made full of ſharp points, which might pierce his whole body in all parts. After this a third command was, that they ſhould put him on a Helmet with a ſharp nail that might pierce his head , and come to be clenched below his feet. Finally by his command they hung a Target about his neck ſo heavy, that it might cruſh all the bones in his body. All this being punctually and ſpeedily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Prince of darkneſs told his Officers: This worthy perſon, alter he had entertained himſelf in Tilting and the like menages of valour, was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to refreſh his toyled limbs with ſweet Baths, and then to retire to ſome ſoft Bed, ſporting himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with other comfortable dalliances of ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Give him now ſomewhat of thoſe refreſhments which are uſual here. They preſently hurl'd him into a fire prepared: then to eaſe him, they placed him in a Bed red hot, where a Toad waited for him of an immenſe ſize, with eyes moſt dreadful, which clipped the Souldier very cloſe, kiſſing and embracing him in ſuch a rueful manner, that it was the moſt dreadful of all the torments he had ſuffered, and brought him even to pangs of death. That good woman, who by

                     <p>Many other pains and torments proportionable to the crimes committed may be ſeen in the works of <hi>Wermero.</hi> A Gentleman of noble Parentage,<note place="margin">Wermer. Mon. Carthu. in faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man by birth, by divine inſpiration became a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtercian Monk. He entred upon this courſe of life, and continued with ſuch great courage, that he ſtuck not to challenge the Devil, and bid him defiance. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy made his Cell the field of battail. Here he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted him firſt with whips: then upon a certain occaſion gave him ſuch blows, that the blood burſt out at his mouth and noſe. At the noiſe the Monks came in, and finding him half dead, they carried him to his Bed, where he lay for the ſpace of three dayes without giving any ſignes of life. In which time in the company of an Angel he deſcended into a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place, where he ſaw a Man ſeated in a Chair of fire, and certain Women very beautiful thruſting into his mouth burning torches, drawing them out at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of his body, which had been the inſtruments of his ſins. The Monk being aſtoniſhed at this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, the Angel told him: This miſerable wretch was a very powerful man in the world, and much given to Women, and for this reaſon the Devils in ſhape of Women do torment him as thou ſeeſt. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little farther he beheld another, whom the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirits were fleaing alive, and having rubbed all his body over with ſalt, they put him to roaſt upon a Gridiron. This man, ſaid the Angel, was a great Lord, ſo cruel to his Vaſſals, as the Devils are now to him. A little farther they met with other perſons of divers ſtates and conditions, which were tormented with ſeveral kinds of torments: Many Religious both
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:51068:238"/>men and women, whoſe lives had been contrary to their profeſſion: Talkers, Cenſurers of other mens lives, Slaves to their bellies, defiled with luſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like vices. To theſe the Miniſters of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in ſhape of moſt ugly fellows, gave many blows, in ſuch ſort, that they daſhed out their brains, and made their eyes flye out of their heads, becauſe in their works they were blind, and without judgement: a chaſtiſement,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.</note> which the Wiſe-man appoints for ſuch like perſons. Afterwards he lifted up his eyes, and beheld one faſtned to a horrible Wheel, turning in ſuch a dreadful manner, that the Monk here was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beſides himſelf. That, thou ſeeſt, is terrible, ſaid the Angel; but far more terrible will be what thou ſhalt now ſee. At the inſtant the Wheel began to run from aloſt down to the moſt profound depths, with ſuch horrid joggs, and with ſuch noiſe, as if all the World, Earth, Heaven, and all were breaking in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At this ſo ſudden and direful accident all the Priſoners and Goalers of Hell brake out into great cries, curſing and damning him, that came in the Wheel. This man, ſaid the Angel, is <hi>Judas</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, who betrayed his Maſter: and as long as he ſhall raign in glory, which ſhall be world without end, ſo long ſhall this miſerable wretch lye thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. With theſe Repreſentations God hath given us to underſtand the proportion his Juſtice obſerves in his chaſtiſements, to make us form ſome lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the greatneſs of thoſe pains: they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed far greater than what ever we can conceive by all the rigour imaginable exhibited to the ſenſes. And in regard what enters by the ſenſes prevails more with us, for this reaſon he repreſents unto us the torments of the ſoul ſutably to thoſe ſo horrible to our ſenſes, as is to daſh out the brains, and make the brains flye out of the head. For though it be true that this effect is not wrought indeed, yet the torments inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the damned Souls are without companion greater,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:51068:238"/>then it would be for a man in this life to be ſo beaten about the head, till his brains and eyes flew out. Let us therefore fear the Divine juſtice: and let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that in thoſe parts of the body we offend God Almighty with greater delight, we ſhall be ſure to be puniſhed with greater torment.</p>
                     <p>And here may be given this further inſtruction, that as theſe and many ſuch like ſtories, related for more variety of diſcourſe in this Treatiſe, oblige us not to a full and abſolute belief of them: ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the favour of ſo much credit at leaſt, as is allowed to <hi>Livy, Juſtine,</hi> or other Chronicle-writers; eſpecially the Recorders of theſe being ſuch, as are no leſs grave and wiſe, and acknowledge moreover a greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of conſcience not to wrong the World with lies, or empty relations taken up upon the account of frivolous reports, eſpecially in matters of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, And as we think it not amiſs to make uſe, as occaſion ſerves, of profane Examples and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in confirmation of what we uſually either ſpeak or write, ſo without all doubt the ſame uſe of Sacred and Eccleſiaſtical occurrences may be no leſs available in ſuch matters as theſe.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ALl which hath been ſaid of the pains in Hell, is far ſhort of that which really they are. There is great difference betwixt the knowledge we have by relation, and that which we learn by experience. The <hi>Machabees</hi> knew that the Temple of the Lord was already prophaned, deſerted, and deſtroyed. They had heard of it, and lamented it; but when they ſaw
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:51068:239"/>with their eyes the Sanctuary lye deſolate, the Altar prophaned, and the Gates burnt, there was then no meaſure in their tears. They tore their garments, caſt aſhes upon their heads, threw themſelves upon the ground, and their complaints aſcended as high as Heaven. If then the relation and diſcourſe of the pains of Hell makes us tremble, what ſhall be the ſight and experience. This notwithſtanding the conſideration of what hath been ſaid may help us to form ſome conception of the terrour and horrour of that place of eternal ſorrow. Let us, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, deſcend into Hell whileſt we live, that we may not deſcend thither when we are dead. Let us draw ſome fruit from thence during our lives, from whence nothing but torment is to be had after death. The principal fruits, which may be drawn from that conſideration, are theſe. In the firſt place, an ardent love and ſincere gratitude towards our Creator; that having ſo often deſerved Hell, he hath not yet ſuffered us to fall into it. How many be there now in Hell, who for their firſt mortal ſin, and onely for that one have been ſent thither? and we, notwithſtanding the innumerable ſins, which we have committed, are yet ſpared. What did God find in us, that he ſhould uſe a mercy towards us for ſo many ſins, which he did not afford to others for ſo few? Why are we not then more grateful for ſo many benefits, which we have no wayes deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? How grateful would a damned perſon be, if God ſhould free him from thoſe flames, wherein he is tormented, and place him in the ſame condition we now are? What a life would he lead? what penance would he undergoe? what auſterity would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a pleaſure unto him? and how grateful would he be unto ſo merciful a benefactor? He hath done no leſs for us, but much more. For, if he hath not drawn us out of Hell, he hath not thrown us into it as we deſerved, which is the greater favour. Tell me if a Creditor ſhould caſt that Debtor into priſon, who
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:51068:239"/>owed him a thouſand. Duckets, and after the enduring of much affliction at laſt releaſe him: or ſhould ſuffer another, who owed him fifty thouſand Duckets to goe up and down free without touching a thread of his garment: Whether of the Debtors received the greater benefit? I believe thou wilt ſay the latter. More then are we endebted unto God Almighty, and therefore ought to ſerve him better. Conſider how a man would live, who ſhould be reſtored to life after he had been in Hell. Thou ſhouldſt live better, ſince thou art more indebted to Almighty God.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> Dialog. cap. <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> writes of one, who though he had not been releaſed out of Hell, but onely was upon the point of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet led afterwards ſuch a life, that the change was admirable. (The Saint ſayes, that a Monk called <hi>Peter,</hi> who, before he retired to the deſert, was in a trance for ſome time as dead: and being reſtored to his ſenſes made this relation; That he had had a ſight of Hell, and that he had ſeen in it great chaſtiſements, and innumerable places full of fire; and that he knew ſome, who had been very powerful in the World, hanging in the midſt of the flames; and himſelf being now at the brink to be caſt into the ſame, he ſaw on the ſudden a bright ſhining Angel, who withheld him, faying ; Return to thy body, and confider well, with what care and diligence it ſuits with thy profeſſion to lead thy life from hence forwards. So it was, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his body, he treated it with ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of penance, watches and faſts, that although he ſhould not have ſpoken a word, his manner of life did publiſh ſufficiently what he had ſeen.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly we are taught to exerciſe an invincible patience in ſuffering the afflictions and troubles of this life, that by enduring theſe thankfully we may eſcape thoſe of the other. He who ſhall conſider the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe torments which he deſerves, will not grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the pains of this ſhort life how bitter ſoever. There is no ſtate or condition upon earth, how nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:51068:240"/>how poor, how miſerable ſoever, which the damned would not endure, and think it an infinite happineſs, if they might change with it. Neither is there any courſe of life ſo auſtere, which he who had once experienced thoſe burning flames, if he might live again, would not make more rigorous. He who hath once deſerved eternal torments let him never murmure at temporal evils; let his mouth be ever ſtopt from complaining of the croſſes, or petty inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries offered him in this life, who hath committed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences worthy the pains of the other. From this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration there was nothing which the Saints would not willingly ſuffer, no penance which they would not undergoe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.</note> Wherefore St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſpoken of the ſmoke, which aſcended from the torments of the damned for a world of worlds, and and that they did not reſt by day nor night, preſently adds, <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints;</hi> becauſe ſeeing that all the troubles of this life were temporal, and the torments of the other eternal, nothing that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſeemed much unto them.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.

If thou goe into a Bath, and ſhalt find it exceſſive hot, think on Hell; If thou art tormented with the heat, think on Hell; If thou art tormented with the heat of ſome violent Fever, paſs unto the conſideration of thoſe eternal flames, which burn without end: and think that if a Bath or Calenture ſo afflict thee, how ſhalt thou endure that River of fire.</q> 
                     <note place="margin">Homil. <hi>2.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> Ep. ad Theſſ.</note> And further the ſame Saint. <q>When thou ſhalt ſee any thing great in this preſent life, think preſently of the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſo thou ſhalt not value it much; and when thou ſhalt ſee any thing terrible, think on Hell, and thou wilt laugh at it. When the concupiſcence or deſire of any
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:51068:240"/>temporal thing ſhall afflict thee, think that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of ſin is of no eſtimation, and that the pleaſure of it is nothing. For if the fear of Lawes, which are enacted upon earth, be of that force, that they are able to deterre us from evil actions, much more will the thought of things to come, and that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal chaſtiſement of eternal pain. If the fear of an Earthly King divert us from many evils, how much more ſhall the fear of a King eternal?</q> If the fight of a dead man detain us, much more ſhall the thought of hell and that eternal death. If we often think of hell, we ſhall never fall into it.</p>
                  <p>We ought alſo often to call to minde the evils of the next life, that we may more deſpiſe the pleaſures of this: becauſe temporal felicity uſes often to end in eternal miſerie. All that is precious in the world, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wealth, fame, pleaſure, all the ſplendour of the Earth is but ſmoke and a ſhadow, if we compare the ſmall duration of them with the eternity of thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other world. Put all the Silver in the world together in one heap, all the Gold, all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious-ſtones, Diamonds, Emeralds with all other the richeſt Jewels, all the Triumphs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> all the Dainties of the <hi>Aſſytians, &amp;c.</hi> all would deſerve to be of no other value than dirt, ignominy, and gall, if to be poſſeſſed with hazard of falling at laſt into the pit of Hell. Let us call to mind that ſentence of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour: <hi>What will it avail a man, to gain the whole world, if he loſe his ſoul?</hi> If they ſhould make us Lords and Maſters, I ſay not of great wealth, but of the whole world, we ſhould not admit of it with the leaſt hazard of being damned for ever. Let one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the contents and regalo's imaginable, let him be raiſed up to the higheſt pitch of honour, let him triumph with all the greatneſs of the world, All this is but a dream, if after this mortal life he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at length plunged into hell-fire. Whoſoever ſhould conſider the lamentable day, in which two Sons,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:51068:241"/>and three Daughters, and his Wife the Empereſs were put to death in preſence of the Emperor <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and afterwards himſelf was bereaved of life by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a daſtardly Coward and vicious fellow, no doubt but he would eſteem as very vain and of no worth all the twenty years of his Raign in his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Empire and Majeſty, though his puniſhment was not to laſt for ever, in regard he had the good fortune to ſave his Soul. Wherefore if one onely diſaſtrous day, after the enjoying of ſo much felicity and greatneſs of the world for twenty years ſpace, is ſufficient to cauſe a contempt of all that pomp, and make the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as ſmoke, not onely one year of affliction, not a thouſand ages, but eternity in torments how will it, make all humane proſperity to ſeem nothing elſe but a ſhadow and a dream? If the ſad death of one, though he ſaves his ſoul, ſhews the vanity of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicities, The lamentable death of one, who is damned to Hell, and an eternity of unſpeakable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how will it make evident, that all felicity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane greatneſs is nothing but ſmoke, a ſhadow, and nothing? Let us reflect a thought upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Heliogabolus,</hi> who gave ſo great a ſcope to all his ſenſual appetites, and was moſt exactly induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in making uſe of time to the advantage of his pleaſures, What account are we to make of his two years and eight moneths raign, if we give credit to <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Eutropius,</hi> turning our conſideration to the other Scene of his miſerable death. For the <hi>Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Souldiers having drawn him out of a Sink or Privy, where he had hid himſelf, then haling him upon the ground, they threw him into an other Sink moſt filthy and abominable; but in regard there was not room enough for his whole body, they pull'd him out again, and dragging him through the great place called <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and other publick Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> at laſt they caſt him into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> having firſt tied great ſtones about him, to the end he might never appear more,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:51068:241"/>nor obtain interrement. All this was done to the great content of the people, and approbation of the Senate. Who ſhould ſee this nice and effeminate Prince wallowing in the Sink, abuſed by his Souldiers, and drowned in the <hi>Tyber,</hi> what eſtimate would he frame of all his greatneſe? But ſee him now in the horrid Sink of Hell, abuſed by the Devils, and plunged into that pit of fire and brimſtone, where he is to ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive torments for all eternity; what will that ſhort time of his Empire ſeem, being compared, I do not ſay with three hundred thouſand millions of years, but with an eternity of pains, which he is to ſuffer, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the paſt glory of his Empire, and ſplendour of his fortunes to vaniſh into ſmoke?

                     </gap>dours, with which the beholders are much taken: but all at laſt ends in a little ſmoke and burnt paper. So it is. Whilſt the Wheel of felicities was in motion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtile of St. <hi>James,</hi> that is to ſay, whilſt our life laſts, its fortune and proſperity appeared moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but ceaſing, all comes to end in ſmoke: and he, that fares beſt in it, becomes a firebrand of Hell. <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſaid well, that when a ſtrong fever.<note place="margin">Raban in Eccl.</note> or ſome great unexpected change in his eſtate happens to one, it makes him forget all his former contents in health, and wealth: his ſickneſs and adverſity taking up ſo the whole man, as that he has no leaſure to employ his thoughts upon any thing elſe; and if perhaps any paſſage of his former condition chance to come to his minde, it gives him no ſatisfaction, but rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his pain. Wherefore if even temporal evils, though very ſhort, are ſufficient to make former felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of many years vaniſh: what impreſſion will tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods make in us, if we employ our thoughts upon eternal evils?</p>
                  <p>Beſides this the eternity of torments in hell, which is to be ſuffered hereafter without profit, may move us
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:51068:242"/>to husband the ſhort time of this life moſt to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and with the greateſt fruit. How many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Souls now ſuffer thoſe eternal pains for not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying one day in pennance, nor endeavouring to make one good confeſſion? What would a damned Soul give for one quarter of an hour out of ſo many dayes and years, which are loſt, and ſhall not have one inſtant allowed him? Thou, who now liveſt, and haſt time, loſe not that which imports ſo much, and once loſt, can never be redeemed. (<hi>Peter Reginaldus</hi> writes, that an holy Religious man, being in prayer, heard a moſt lamentable voice; whereupon demanding, Who he was, and Why he lamented; it was anſwered, I am one of the damned. And thou muſt know, That I and the reſt of the damned Souls lament and bewail nothing more bitterly, than to have loſt time in the ſins we have committed. O miſerable creatures, who for having loſt a ſhort ſpace of time loſe an eternity of felicity! They come to know too late the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that which they have loſt, and ſhall never come to regain it.) Let us now make uſe of time whileſt we may gain eternity; and let us not loſe that with pleaſure, which cannot be recovered with grief. Let us now weep for our ſins with profit, that we way not weep for our pains without fruit. Let us hear what St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Bernard.

                     <p> The infinite guilt of mortal Sin, by which we loſe the felicity of heaven, and fall into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evils.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe horrible and ſtupendious malice of mortal ſin is ſo foul and accurſed, that though committed in an inſtant it deſerves the torments of hell for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and an unlawful pleaſure, enjoyed by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but for one moment, deprives and diſinherits him of eternal felicity. Becauſe therefore the ſcope of this work is to beget ſuch diſeſteem of temporal goods, as for them we may not loſe the eternal, I thought it not beſides my purpoſe to procure, as much as I could, a horror and deteſtation of ſin, which is the occaſion of the loſs of heaven: and therefore intend in this place to ſay ſomething of the malice of it, the rather becauſe it conduces much to the knowledge of thoſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are betwixt things temporal and things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; Whereof the moſt notable is, that as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods are of that nature, that he who loves and ſeeks them with ſollicitude, moſt commonly falls into that horrible evil of ſin: So he who loves and ſets his heart on things eternal, ſecures himſelf againſt it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, having treated of the eternal pains of hell, that we may not wonder at the ſeverity of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:51068:243"/>it was neceſſary that we ſhould ſay ſomething of the horrible and grievous malice of ſin, for which ſo infinite a puniſhment is inflicted. Many admire that a ſin committed in an inſtant ſhould deſerve the eternal puniſhment of ſo terrible and cruel torments. But this proceeds from their ignorance; becauſe they know not the malice of a mortal ſin. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whoſe deep underſtanding was enlightned by an eſpecial grace, wondered rather that there were not two Hells, and that a new one was not created for that Chriſtian, who durſt offend his God after he was incarnated for his redemption. And Divines generally affirm, that the chaſtiſement of ſin in hell is much leſs than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Who will not then admire this Monſter of miſchief, that being but one evil draws after it ſo many, and that one ſin ſhould deſerve ſo many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and yet have a malice capable of more?</p>
                  <p>A terrible caſe that for a ſin, which paſt onely in thought, which none knew but God, and he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, and perhaps not he neither, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and doubtful of his own conſent, and which endured no longer than an inſtant, ſhould yet be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſo real and eternal pains. The reaſon is, That ſuch is the intenſion of malice in ſin, that it is equivalent to the extenſion of an infinite evil. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and the ſin are like the ſhadow and the body; The ſin is the body and the ſolid evil, The puniſhment but as the ſhadow. And in the reaſon of a true and real evil, the ſin as far exceeds the puniſhment of hell fire, as a man exceeds his ſhadow. For as that is truly and really a man, and this but a man in appearance: ſo ſin is truly an evil, the pain onely appears ſo, but is in truth a good, being an act of juſtice cauſed by God, who can cauſe no evil. Hence you may trace the malignity of a ſin, in compariſon whereof the pains of hell, although ſo terrible, are not evils, but their ſhadow; and may alſo learn, that the commiſſion of a mortal ſin is asmuch to be feared above the pains
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:51068:243"/>of eternity, as a real ſword before its ſhadow. The ſword kills, the ſhadow at moſt can but fright. So a mortal ſin is that, which takes away the life of the Soul: the pains can onely fear us: but without ſin the torments of hell are not of power to kill or hurt us. See then what a fool thou art, if to avoid ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil thou preſumeſt to commit a mortal ſin, which is as great a folly, as to ſtye from the ſhadow of a ſword, and run thy ſelt upon the point.</p>
                  <p>It is true that ſin is really an evil, and the eternal fire of Hell in compariſon of it but a ſhadow; but by this ſhadow we may judge the greatneſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and by the terribleneſs of the puniſhment the grievouſneſs of the ſin. For as by the ſhadow we know the bulk of the body, although we ſee it not: ſo by the pains of Hell we conjecture the malice and enormity of ſin, which appears not. What would we ſay of a body, which, the Sun being at midday and in his height, ſhould caſt a ſhadow of an infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion? This could not be, unleſs the height of that body ſhould riſe unto the Sphear of the Sun, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed oppoſite unto it ſhould thence produce ſo vaſt a ſhadow. In this manner ſin cauſeth a pain of infinite extenſion, becauſe the intenſion of its malice reaches ſo high, as to oppoſe it ſelf unto God, who being the chief good, ſin muſt needs become the chief evil; I ſpeak of mortal ſin. If we therefore tremble at the thought of Hell, we may ſhake at that of ſin. Who is not amazed, that God ſhould behold a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his own burning in flames, and ſhould there leave him without compaſſion for all eternity? But this is not cauſed by want of goodneſſ in God, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of malice in ſin: not becauſe the mercy of God hath limits, but becauſe the wickedneſs of man hath none. So hainous then is the offence of a mortal ſin, that eternal flames cannot purge it, nor torments give a greater ſatisfaction, than what is due unto the Di-Juſtice. This is that, which the Lord ſaid by <hi>Oſeas;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

Such is the grievouſneſs of ſin, that it makes the ſweetneſs, bounty, and divine pity of God not to companionate that Soul, which is in the bitterneſs of Hell.</p>

                     <p>Sin is then an infinite offence againſt God. Let it not therefore appear much unto him, who knows the ineffable greatneſs and perfection of the Divine eſſence, that though committed in an inſtant, it ſhould deſerve an eternity of puniſhment. For by how much greater is the Majeſty of God, which is deſpiſed, by ſo much greater is the injury offered him; and therefore as the Majeſty of God, which is deſpiſed by ſin, is infinite, ſo the deſpite of it muſt contain in it ſelf a certain kinde of infinity. By how much greater is the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to a perſon, by ſo much greater is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect and affront offered him; And as to God there is due an infinite reverence, ſo the injurie done him is of an inexplicable malice, which with no good works of a pure creature, how many and great ſoever, can be expiated.<note place="margin">Leſſ. de perfec. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi. li. <hi>13.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi> nu. <hi>187.</hi>

                        <q>So great (ſaith a grave Doctor) is the malignity of a mortal ſin, that being put in the ballance of Divine Juſtice it would out-waigh all the good works of all the Saints, although they were a thouſand times more and greater than they are. Which conſideration, although moſt fearful, yet it ought not to ſeem incredible: becauſe the good works, with which God is honoured by his Saints, although conſidered in themſelves they are of great value, and by his grace worthy of eternal life, yet in reſpect of God, unto whom they add nothing, and who is nothing better by them, they are not valuable: Unto whoſe divine goodneſs, not onely
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:51068:244"/>they but infinitely more and greater are but a debt. But for God to be deſpiſed by his Creature, who by infinite titles is obliged to ſerve him; and who ought to bear him (if he could) an infinite love, and reverence him with an infinite honour, is a thing ſo highly repugnant to his Majeſty and benefits, that he apprehends it more in the nature of evil, than all the good works of the world in the nature of good: and if God were capable of grief, would more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him, than all the pious actions of the Saints content him.</q> Certainly amongſt men the honour, which is given to one, who deſerves it, takes not ſo much, as a contempt done unto him, who merits it not. A King values not much the honour which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by his Vaſſals, becauſe he takes it not for a courteſie but a duty; but to be outraged and ſcorned by one, eſpecially whom he had favoured with his benefits, ſticks near unto his heart; for not onely Kings, but all men think honour due unto them, and diſreſpect an injurie. And as fire being inordinately applyed to the hand makes it ſenſible of a greater grief, that it can receive delight by being ſound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe exceſſive heat is repugnant, and a natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per due unto it; ſo diſreſpects and affronts offered to a noble perſonage, which are repugnant to his worth, grieves him more, than he can be pleaſed with all the honours and reſpects due unto him. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment amongſt men ſo quick as that of diſhonour, nor any thing which cauſes more grief and vexation. If ſome perſon of quality ſhould have his hat pluckt off from his head in ſcorn, and receive a dozen of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonadoes from ſome baſe fellow, that affront would not be recompenſed, although a thouſand ſhould put off their caps to him, and kiſs his hand. By this may in ſome ſort appear the ſtupendious irreverence and incivility towards God in a mortal ſin; in ſo much as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it kicking or ſpurning the Son of God. And therefore it is no marvel, if one onely grievous
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:51068:245"/>offence over-weigh all the ſervice and honours done by the Saints and holy Angels, and that all that they have or can do, cannot in rigour ſatisfie for one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin. This is the reaſon why it was neceſſary that God ſhould become man, being the Divine Juſtice could not be appeaſed with leſs than the ſatisfaction of a Divine perſon. Let thoſe therefore ceaſe to marvel, that a momentary ſin ſhould be puniſht with eternal torments, who ſee that for ſin God was made man, and died for man. And certainly it is a far greater wonder, that God ſhould die for the ſin of another, than that man ſhould for his own ſin ſuffer an eternal puniſhment. And if the malice of ſin be ſo exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that nothing could ſatisfie for it leſs than God, it is nothing ſtrange, that that, which hath no limit nor bound in evil, ſhould have no limit in puniſhment, but ſhould exceed all time, and be eternal. And if a treaſon committed againſt a temporal Prince be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with loſs of life and goods of the Traitor, and with the puniſhment alſo of his poſterity, which, in as much as concerns the Prince, is eternal: Why ſhould not the offence of a vile worm againſt his Creator be tormented with eternal pains? The greatneſs of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour decreaſes and grows leſs according to the height and dignity of the perſon honoured, ſo as that honour, which done to an ordinary perſon, would ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, given unto a Prince is nothing. And to the contrary the greatneſs of an injury riſes and grows higher according to the worth of him, who is injured: ſo as God, who is infinite, being the perſon offended, deſerves that the injury done unto him ſhould be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed with an infinite puniſhment at leaſt in time, or that he, who ſatisfies for it, ſhould be a perſon of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worth and perfection.</p>
                     <p>From hence it follows, that the guilt of mortal ſin being ſo horrid, there can be no ſatisfaction of a pure creature ſufficient to expiate it, nor any merit which can deſerve the pardon. Let us grant that <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:51068:245"/>never offended, nor contaminated the whole race of mankind with his ſin. Let us grant that there had never been a ſin of <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> or any other Man or Angel whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and that there had been but one onely mortal ſin, the leaſt of all others, committed by a man in a wilderneſs without witneſs, by night, and that onely in thought: yet ſuch were the grievouſneſs of this one ſin, that for it no puniſhment of the creatures were ſufficient to ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice. If God ſhould ruine Heaven, throw down the Stars, drie up the Sea, confound the Elements, and ſtrike whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with thunder, all would not give an equal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Divine Juſtice for this one ſin. For this deſtruction of Heaven and Earth and Man were but of things finite and limited, and the injured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is God, who is infinite, and betwixt finit and infinite there is no proportion. In like manner no merit of meer creatures were ſufficient to deſerve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it. If all mankind ſhould cloath themſelves in ſackcloth, and faſt with bread and water, If all the Martyrs ſhould offer up their torments, and all the Confeſſours their penances, and the very Mother of God all her vertues, and ſhould diſſolve her ſelf into tears, all were not enough to deſerve the pardon of that one ſin; Onely the Son of God could be ſufficient ſatisfaction. Let men conſider this; let them weigh the grievouſneſs of a ſin againſt God, and let them tremble at the very thought that poſſibly they may commit it.</p>

For if we conſider Who it is that ſins, it is a moſt vile and wretched man, who preſumes to lift up his hands againſt his Creator. And what is Man but a Veſſel of dung, a Sink of corruption, and by birth a Slave of the Devil? and yet he dares offend his Maker. An offence againſt God were moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, though from another God (if it were poſſible) infinite and equal to himſelf; but that his creature ſhould be ſo audacious againſt his omnipotent Lord, is beyond amazement.</p>
                     <p>But What is that, which a ſinner does, when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends? It is, according to St. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> an endeavour to pluck the Crown from the head of God, and place it upon his own.

If any of theſe things were attempted againſt a Majeſty upon earth, it were enough to make the offenders fleſh to be pluckt off with pincers, to have him torn in pieces with
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:51068:246"/>four horſes, to pull down his houſe, and ſow the place with ſalt, and make his whole Linage infamous. If ſuch an offence committed by one man againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, betwixt whom the difference is not great, being both equal in nature, be ſo hainous, what ſhall it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve being committed againſt God the Lord and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, whoſe immenſe greatneſs is infinitely diſtant from the nature of his creature? O good God, who is able to explicate what a ſinner does againſt thee and himſelf? he deſpiſes thy Majeſty, razes out thy Law from his heart, laughs at thy Juſtice, ſcorns thy threats, deſpiſes thy promiſes, makes a ſolemn renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of thy glory thou haſt promiſed him, and all to bind himſelf an eternal ſlave unto Satan, deſiring rather to pleaſe thine enemy than thee, who art his Father, his Friend, and all his good: deſiring rather to die eternally by diſpleaſing thee, than to enjoy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever by ſerving thee.</p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee Where and in What place a ſinner preſumes to ſin, and be a Traitor unto his God. It is even in his own world, in his own houſe, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Creator looks upon him, he offends him. If a ſin were committed where. God could not ſee it, it were yet an enormous fault; but to injury his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor before his face, what an unſpeakable impudence? If he who ſins could go into another world, where God did not inhabit, and there in ſecret under the earth ſhould ſin after ſuch a manner as onely himſelf ſhould know it, yet it were a temerarious boldneſs; but to ſin in his own houſe, which is this world, what hell doth it not deſerve? For a man onely to lay his hand upon his ſword in the Palace of a King is capital, and deſerves death. For a ſinner then by his ſins to ſpurn and crucifie the Son of God, in the houſe of his Father, and before his face, what underſtanding can conceive the greatneſs of ſuch a malice? And therefore <hi>David</hi> with reaſon diſſolved himſelf into tears, becauſe he had ſinned in the preſence of God,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:51068:247"/>and with a grief, which pierced his heart, cried out, <hi>I have done evil before thee.</hi> Beſides this, we not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin againſt God in his own houſe, but even in his armes, whileſt we are upheld by his omnipotency. If there were a Son ſo wicked, who whileſt he was che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in his Mothers boſom, ſhould ſtrike and buffet her, and endeavour to kill her with his poniard, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would think that Child ſome Devil incarnate. How then dares man offend God, who ſuſtains, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and hath redeemed him? Certainly that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to be eſteemed worſe than a Devil.</p>
                     <p>The hainouſneſs of this malice in ſin is much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Helpes, which a ſinner uſes to effect it. For he turns thoſe very divine benefits, which he hath received from God, againſt him, who gave them. The ſenſe, which men uſually have of ingratitude, is moſt apprehenſive. If to forget a benefit be ingratitude, to deſpiſe it is an injurie: but to uſe it againſt the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, I know not how to call it. This does he who ſins, making uſe of thoſe creatures, which God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his ſervice, to offend him, and convert his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benefits into arms againſt God himſelf. What could we ſay, if a King to honour his Souldier ſhould make him a Knight, arm him with his own arms, and ſhould girt his ſword about him with his own hands, and that the Souldier, ſo ſoon as he was poſſeſt of the ſword, ſhould draw it againſt the King, and murther him? This wickedneſs, which ſeems impoſſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, is ordinary in man towards God; who being honoured ſo many wayes by his Creator, and enriched by ſo many benefits, for as much as in him lies, bereaves God of his honour, and, according to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> deſires to bereave him of his life. His underſtanding, which he receiv'd from God, he uſes in finding out a way to execute his ſin; with his hands he performs it, and with all his power offends him, who gave them. Beſides, the impudence of man arrives at that height, that he makes God himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:51068:247"/>him to ſin. This is that, which our Lord much complains of, when he ſayes by his Prophet, <hi>You made me ſerve you in your wickedneſs;</hi> becauſe God concurring to every action and natural motion of man, who without his concurrence could neither move hand, nor foot, nor tongue, man diſpoſing his tongue to murmur, and his hand to ſteal, makes uſe of the concourſe of God againſt God himſelf. Who is ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſs and inhumane to enforce the Father to aſſiſt in the murther of his onely Son, compelling the Fathers hand to execute the ſtroke, which is to pierce the heart of his onely begotten? Equivalent to this is done by a ſinner, making God to concurre to an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which man ſinning crucifies again the Son of God. What cruelty is this in a ſinner, who for this onely impiety deſerves a thouſand deaths?</p>
                     <p>But if we ſhall conſider, Why man does this: it is a circumſtance which will amaze us at the malice of ſin. Why does a ſinner give this diſguſt unto his God? Wherefore does he deſpiſe his Creator? Wherefore is he a Traitor unto the Lord of the World? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does he kick and ſpurn at Jeſus Chriſt? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does he abhorre his Redeemer? Wherefore cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies he the Son of God? What reaſon hath he for ſo monſtrous a wickedneſs? Is it perchance, becauſe the world ſhould not be ruin'd? Is it perchance, becauſe his ſalvation ſtands upon it? Is it perhaps to make himſelf a God? Is it perhaps in reſpect or for love of another God? No, it is none of theſe, but only for a baſe and filthy pleaſure, for a fooliſh fancy of man, becauſe he will, and no more. O horrid inſolence! O mad fury of men, which without a cauſe ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offend their Creator! How is it, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens reſolve not into thunderbolts, and throw a thouſand deaths upon them, who do and dare by their ſins irritate and offend ſo good and gracious a God?</p>
                     <p>The Manner alſo of our ſinning would aſtoniſh any,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:51068:248"/>who ſhould ſeriouſly conſider it. It is with ſo much impudence, contempt of God, and ſuch a Luciferian pride: After having heard ſo many examples of his chaſtiſements executed upon ſinners, After having ſeen that the moſt beautiful and glorious of all the Angels, and with him innumerable others were thrown from Heaven, and made firebrands in Hell for one ſin, and that onely in thought, After having ſeen the firſt man for one ſin of gluttony baniſht from the Paradiſe of pleaſure into this valley of tears, diſpoyled of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſupernatural endowments, and condemned to death, After having ſeen the World drowned, and the Cities of <hi>Pontapolis</hi> burnt with fire from Heaven, After having ſeen thoſe ſeditious againſt <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſwallowed by the earth, and with their Children, Goods and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſink alive into Hell, After having known that ſo many have been damned for their offences, After that the Son of God had ſuffered upon the Croſs for our ſins, After all this to ſin, is an impudence never heard of, and an intolerable contempt of the Divine Juſtice. Beſides, what greater ſcorn and contempt of God than this, that God, who is worthy of all honour and love, and the Devil, who is our profeſſed enemy, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to our Souls, the one to ſave them, the other to torment them in eternal flames, yet we adhere to Satan, and preferre him before Chriſt our Saviour and Redeemer, and that ſo much to our prejudice, as by the loſs of eternal glory, and captivating our ſelves unto eternal torments and ſlavery? No way of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring can be imagined more injurious, than when by the interpoſing of ſome other vile and infamous, he, who is worthy of all love and honour, is put by and ſlighted. The manner alſo of ſinning aggravates the ſin, as the ſinner doth, by loſing thereby eternal goods. Though he, who ſinneth, loſt nothing, yet the offence againſt God were great, and the affront to Reaſon it ſelf not inconſiderable. But well knowing the great damages, and puniſhments likewiſe, that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:51068:248"/>attend ſin, and the evident hazard he runs, and yet to ſin, is a ſtrange temerity and impudency.</p>
                     <p>If we ſhall likewiſe conſider, When it is that we ſin, we ſhall ſinde this circumſtance no leſs to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our offences than the former; Becauſe we now ſin, When we have ſeen the Son of God nailed unto the Croſs, that we ſhould not ſin: When we have ſeen God ſo ſweet unto us, as to be incarnate for our good, humbling himſelf to be made man, and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to death, even the death of the Croſs for our redemption: having inſtituted the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a remedy againſt ſin, eſpecially that of his moſt holy Body and Blood, which was a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe expreſſion of his love. To ſin after we had ſeen God ſo good unto us, ſo obliging unto us with thoſe not to be imagined favours, is a Circumſtance which ought much to be pondered in our hearts, and might make us forbear the offending of ſo loving a Lord. And that Chriſtian who ſins after all this, is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed worſe than a Devil. For the Devil never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt that God, who had ſhed his blood for him, or who had been made an Angel for him, or who had pardoned ſo much as one ſin of his. When thoſe ſinned, who were under the law of nature, they alſo had not ſeen the Son of God die for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Chriſtian hath; for which, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, There ought a new Hell to be made for him. And there is no doubt but Chriſtians will deſerve new tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and greater than thoſe, who have not had the knowledge of God, nor received ſo many benefits from him. This is confirmed by what is written of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi> the Abbot, who finding in the Deſert a dead mans head, and removing it with his ſtaffe out of the way, it began to ſpeak, which he hearing, demanded, Who it was. It anſwered, I am a Prieſt of the Gentils, which heretofore dwelt in this place, and am now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many of them in the middle of a burning fire, ſo great, that the flames encompaſs us both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:51068:249"/>and beneath. And is there, replyed the Saint, any place of greater torment? Yes, ſaid the dead; Greater is that, which they ſuffer who are below us. For we, who knew not God, are not ſo ſeverely dealt with, as thoſe who knowing have denied him, or not complyed with his holy will. Theſe are below us, and ſuffer far greater torments than we.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Circumſtances obſerved by <hi>Tully,</hi> and are all found to aggravate the guilt of our ſins. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that, added by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> wanting; which is, About what. About what do we offend God? About what happens this great preſumption, but about things which import not, but rather endamage us; About complying with a ſenſual guſt, which in the end bereaves us of health, of honour, of ſubſtance, and even of pleaſure it ſelf, ſuffering many dayes of grief for a moment of delight; About things of the earth, which are vile and tranſitory: and about goods of the world, which are falſe, ſhort, and deceitful. What would we ſay, if for a thing of ſo ſmall value as a ſtraw one man ſhould kill another? No more than a ſtraw are all the felicities of the world in reſpect of thoſe of heaven; and for a thing of ſo ſmall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are Traitors to God, and crucifie Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that a thouſand times, as often as we ſin mortally againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Againſt whom we offend much aggravates our ſins. For beſides that God is moſt perfect, moſt wiſe, beautiful, immenſe, omnipotent, infinite, we ſin againſt him, who infinitely loves us, who ſuffers us, who heaps his benefits and rewards upon us. To do evil to thoſe, who make much of them, even wilde beaſts abhorre it. What is it then for thee to injure him, who loved thee more then himſelf; who hath done thee all good, that thou ſhouldeſt do no evil? Fear then this Lord, reverence his Majeſty, love his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and offend him no more. This onely conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, To have ſinned againſt ſo good a God, was ſo
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:51068:249"/>grievous unto <hi>David,</hi> that in his penitential Pſalms, he exclaims with tears, and cries out from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his heart, <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſinned.</hi> For although he had ſinned againſt <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias,</hi> and againſt all Iſrael by his ill example, yet it ſeemed unto him, he had onely ſinned againſt God, when he conſidered the infinity of his being, the immenſeneſs of that love, which he had ſo grievouſly offended. Sin then is on all parts moſt virulent, on all parts ſpits forth venome. Behold it on every ſide, it ſtill ſeems worſe; for being the chiefeſt evil, it can on no part appear good: all is monſtrous, all poiſon, all deteſtable, all moſt evil, and therefore deſerves all evil. And it is not much, that that ſhould be chaſtiſed with eternal torments, which oppoſes it ſelf unto the ſweetneſs of an infinite holineſs.</p>

                     <p>Sin is ſo evil, that it is every way evil. It is not onely evil as it is an injury to God, but it is evil in it ſelf in its own nature. For if there were no God, or that God were not offended with it, yet it were a moſt abominable and horrid evil, the greateſt of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the cauſe of all. In regard of this deformity and filthineſs of ſin, the Philoſophers judged it to be abhorred above all things. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle. <hi>3.</hi> Eth.</note> it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die than to do any thing againſt the good of vertue. And <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Peregrinus</hi> with more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſaid; Although I were certain that men ſhould not know it, and that God would pardon it, yet I would not offend for the very filthineſs of ſin. For this <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, That nothing could happen unto man more horrible, than a fault. And even thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who denied the immortality of the Soul, and the providence of God, affirmed, that nothing ſhould make us to commit it. And there hath not wanted ſome Gentils, who have ſuffered great extremities to
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:51068:250"/>avoid a vicious act.<note place="margin">Plut. in Demetrio.</note> 
                        <hi>Democles,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, choſe rather to be boiled in ſcalding water, than to conſent to a filthy act. With reaſon <hi>Hippo</hi> is celebrated amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Matrons, who choſe rather to die than offend. Neither was that horror leſs, which <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turius</hi> conceived againſt uncleanneſs, who ſuffered pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whips, and rigorous torments rather than he would ſin againſt chaſtity. Equal to this, was that of the moſt beautiful youth <hi>Eſpurina,</hi> of whom <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> write,<note place="margin">Ambl. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Virg.</note> That he ſlaſhed and wounded his fair face, that it ſhould not give occaſion to others of offence even by deſire. All thoſe were Gentils, who knew not Chriſt crucified for man, nor ſaw hell open for the puniſhment of ſinners, nor fled from ſin becauſe it was an offence unto God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the enormity and filthineſs it had in it ſelf. This made them endure priſons and tortures rather than admit it. What then ſhould Chriſtians do, who know their Redeemer died to the end they ſhould not ſin, and how much ſin is offenſive to God? Certainly they ought rather to give a thouſand lives and ſouls, than once to injure their Creator by committing an offence, which not onely Gentils, but even Nature hath in horror, which hath planted in brute beaſts, although they cannot ſin, yet a natural averſion from that which looks like ſin. <hi>John</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Gratis</hi> deſired much to have a Foal from a generous Mare, which he had, by her own Son: but could never effect it; neither would ſhe ever admit him, until deceived by cloathing him in ſuch ſort, as ſhe knew him not. But when he was uncloathed, and ſhe diſcovered the deceit, ſhe fell into that ſorrow and ſadneſs, that after ſhe would never feed, but pined her ſelf to death. The like is reported by <hi>Jovianus Pontanus</hi> of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Bitch of his, which he could never (although he cauſed her to be held) make to couple with her Son. So foul and horrible is but the ſhadow and image of ſin even unto brute beaſts. Why ſhould not men then,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:51068:250"/>who are capable of reaſon, and have an obligation unto Gods commandments, ſay and think with St. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. de ſimil. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <q>If I ſhould ſee on this part the filthineſs of ſin, and on the other the terrour of hell, and it were neceſſary for me to fall into one of them, I would rather caſt my ſelf into hell, than admit of ſin: For I had rather enter pure into Hell, than to enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven contaminated with ſin.</q> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever than he be, who is infected with that horrible evil of a mortal ſin, he cannot chooſe but be moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched. For, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Tom. <hi>5.</hi> Ser. <hi>5.</hi> de ie.</note> The greateſt evil is to be evil. And although the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion do not cut the cankered fleſh, yet the ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Patient will not be freed from his infirmity. So although God ſhould not puniſh a Sinner, yet he would not be free from the evil, death, miſery, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin. And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Aug. To. <hi>8.</hi> in. Pſ. <hi>49.</hi>
                        </note> Although we could cauſe, that the day of Judgement ſhould not come, yet we ought not to live ill. This monſtrous deformity of ſin our Lord was pleaſed to expreſs by a viſible Monſter, and that after a moſt ſtrange manner, as is related by <hi>Villaveus.</hi> He writes,<note place="margin">Villaveus lib. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>35.</hi>
                        </note> that in the year 1298. <hi>Caſſanus</hi> King of the <hi>Tartars</hi> with an Army of 200000 horſe entring <hi>Syria</hi> made himſelf Maſter of it, and brought a great terror upon all thoſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries; in ſo much as the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> delivered him his Daughter, although ſhe were a Chriſtian, and he an Infidel, to be his Wife. Not long after the Queen proved with child; and, when her time came, was delivered, not of a Child, but of a moſt horrible and deformed Monſter. Whereat the barbarous King being aſtoniſht and incenſed, by the adviſe of his Council commanded that ſhe ſhould be put to death as an Adultereſs. The poor Lady grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to die with the imputation of a ſin, whereof ſhe was innocent, commended her ſelf to our Saviour, and by divine inſpiration deſired, that before her death the Thing, which ſhe had brought forth, might be
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:51068:251"/>baptized: which was granted; and no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but that Monſter became a moſt beautiful and goodly Boy; and the King amazed at the miracle, with many other of his Subjects became Chriſtian, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging by what had happened the beauty of Grace, and the deformity of Sin, although that defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity proceeded not from any actual ſin either mortal or venial, from which the Child was free, but onely from Original guilt, which without the fault of his proper will deſcended unto him from his Parents. The deformity of ſin comes from the contrariety of it to reaſon, which renders a Sinner more foul and ugly than the moſt horrid Monſter, and more dead in ſoul, than a putrid and dead Carcaſe. <hi>Pliny</hi> admires the force of lightning, which melts the gold and ſilver, and leaves the Purſe, which contained it, untoucht. Such is ſin, which kills the Soul, and leaves the Body ſound and entire. It is a flaſh of lightning ſent from Hell, and worſe than Hell it ſelf, and ſuch leaves the Soul, which it hath blaſted.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I then ſay of the evils which it cauſes? I will onely ſay this, that though it were the beſt thing of the world, yet for the evil effects, which it produces, it ought to be avoided more then death. It bereaves the ſoul of grace, baniſhes the holy Ghoſt, deprives it of the right of heaven, deſpoiles man of all his merits, makes him unworthy of divine protection, and condemns a ſinner unto eternal torments in the other world, and in this to many diſaſters; for there is neither plague, warre, famine, nor infirmity of body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſin hath not been in ſome ſort the occaſion; and therefore thoſe who weep for their afflictions, let them change the object of their tears, and weep for the cauſe, which is their ſinns. Theſe are they, which ought to be lamented, theſe onely deſerve our tears: and all the tears in the world are net ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the leaſt of them. When our Saviour was led to be crucified, he commanded they ſhould not weep for
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:51068:251"/>him but for their ſons. Thoſe ſons are our ſins engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from our corrupt nature: let us weep for them. Finally, ſuch is the malice of a mortal ſin, that he who commits it, deſervs the eternal pains of Hell; and we ought rather to ſuffer a thouſand Hells, than once to commit it.</p>
                     <p>The love of things temporal opens the way to this Monſter of malice, and the deſire of things eternal ſhuts it up. Let every one therefore conſider where he places his affections. Let him hear <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> who ſayes, <hi>The heart of a wiſe man in his right hand, and the heart of a fool in his left;</hi> becauſe the wiſe man places his affection in that which is eternal, and the fool in that which is temporal, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, who ſayes, <hi>He, who it wiſe, ever thinks of the world to come, which leads him to the right hand; and be, who is a fool, thinks onely of the preſent, which is placed on the left.</hi> How deceived ſhall the lovers of the world finde themſelves, when they ſhall ſee, that for their ſins they are placed on the left hand of the Son of God, Judge of the quick and the dead? and how ſhall the lovers of Heaven rejoyce to be placed on his right, as heirs of eternal glory? Abundance and proſperity in temporal goods uſes to be a greater occaſion of ſin, than either a moderate fortune, or an abſolute poverty. Wherefore Chriſt our Redeemer counſelled them, who deſired to follow him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that they ſhould pluck from their hearts all affections, which either had, or might be occaſion of ſin. When the <hi>Machabees</hi> recovered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Macah.</hi> 4.</note> and entring into the Temple found the Altar of Holocauſts prophaned, there was a great doubt amongſt them, whether they ſhould uſe it, becauſe it had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dedicated to God, or deſtroy it, becauſe it had been employed in the ſervice of the Devil. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes, That a good counſel came into their thoughts, which was to deſtroy it, and make a new
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:51068:252"/>one. This good counſel let us follow: let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy what hath or may be an occaſion of ſin; and if the <hi>Machabees</hi> pluckt down that, which had been dedicated to God, becauſe it had been a means for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſin, let us quit the occaſion, wherein not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but we our ſelves have offended, which is our affections to temporal goods, and ſettle them upon the eternal.</p>

But things temporal as well in their own proper eſſence and being, as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal relations and reſpects they have unto others, as they are amongſt Angels moſt contemptible, ſo ought they to be amongſt Men, becauſe really, and in themſelves they are ſo. Vile and baſe they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe little, mutable, and tranſitory. And although in their own nature they were moſt precious and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet with us they ought to be of no value, becauſe they are our Means and not our End: created to be our Slaves, and to ſerve us, and not adored by us as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe they have been the inſtrument of our ſins: and becauſe the Son of God deſcended from Heaven, and died, that we might deſpiſe them. Theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, although they were in themſelves of worth and value, yet unto us ought to render them moſt odious and contemptible.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the great difference betwixt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal, That the one is the End, and the other but the Means; the Eternal is the end of man, but of the Temporal man himſelf is the end. The eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is mans utmoſt perfection, and his perpetual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; the temporal onely to be made uſe of for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the eternal, ſo as the eternal, being our end, is to be loved and deſired for it ſelf, the temporal to be made no account of, but as it may conduce to the obtaining of the eternal. This being a matter of ſo great importance, it is fitting that we ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Open then thine eyes, O man, and reflect Wherefore thou wert born. All things have ſome end for which they are, and thou alſo oughteſt to have one. Thou cameſt not into the world for nothing; for ſomething thou wert created. Open thine eyes, and ſee for what, and having found it, wander not from it; for if thou doeſt, thou art for ever loſt. What Traveller ſets not before his eyes the place, whither he intends to goe and reſt? what Artificer, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:51068:253"/>not unto himſelf ſome <hi>Idaea,</hi> which he is to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in his work? Wherefore then doeſt thou live without thinking why life was given thee? Know that thou wert born for God, and for nothing leſs than God and his ſervice. For this life was beſtowed upon thee: for this thou wert drawn from a not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a being, and didſt paſs from nothing to a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, ſo many thouſands remaining uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who would have ſerved God (if they had a being) better than thy ſelf. See then what thou oweſt him for this bounty; wherein are included two moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable benefits; The one for having created thee, ſetting apart ſo many worthier creatures: The other, for having given thee the moſt noble and excellent end, that poſſibly can be imagined, which is himſelf. When the Children of Iſrael paſt the Red Sea, and <hi>Pharao</hi> and his Souldiers were drowned in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, the Lord would have them celebrate this great benefit for even; and <hi>Moyſes</hi> and all the people ſung praiſes and thanks unto the Lord for their deliverance. See then what thou oweſt unto God for having paſt thee from a not being unto a being, an infinity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures poſſible remaining drowned in the abyſs of nothing. Forget not therefore the benefit of thy Creation, by which from nothing thou becameſt a man, and wert made capable of eternal happineſs. <hi>David</hi> forgot it not: and therefore to his 75. Pſalm gives this remembrance for a Title, <hi>For the end, For him who paſſes,</hi> or leaps from the other part; becauſe he, who paſſes from nothing to be a Creature capable of reaſon and glory, ought alwayes to look upon the end, for which he was created, and from that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make a change of his life, as <hi>David</hi> did of his; who confeſſes in the ſame Pſalm, That his change came from the right hand of the moſt high. Let us then, as he did, remember to change our cuſtoms, from tepid to become fervent, and from Sinners juſt; becauſe the end, for which we were created,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:51068:254"/>is onely God. This onely conſideration of ſo high an end will be able to work a change in us. And for this reaſon <hi>David</hi> gave this Title to another Pſalme, <hi>To the end; For thoſe that are to be changed, or altered.</hi> The holy Prophet well knew the importance of this minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our laſt end, and therefore he repeated it in his Pſalms, to the end that having our attention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fixed upon it, we ſhould not ceaſe to ayme at it, nor ſpoil our intentions by the mixture of other thoughts of leſs conſideration: as he gives to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the Inſcription of his Pſalm 74, which ſayes <hi>Vnto the end; Corrupt not.</hi> Another Verſion ſaies: <hi>To the end: Loſe not;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: Look upon the end, for which thou art created, to the end thou maiſt not loſe it. Let us alſo conſider that glory being no wayes due unto our nature, yet God out of his mercy created us to enjoy it; and when he might have made us for a natural felicity and perfection, was pleaſed to create us for a ſupernatural. Other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he made for us, but us for himſelf. There is no creature hath a more noble end than we; there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seraphin nor Archangel that ſurpaſſes us in this. Let us therefore know the value of it, that we may not loſe it, and with it our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Conſider alſo that if God ſhould not have made thee for himſelf, nor to the end thou mighteſt ſerve him, but had left the free and at liberty, and had onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee a being, yet even for that thou oweſt him all what thou art. The Son, although the Father be not his end, yet ows him all reſpect and reverence, becauſe he begat him. The Husbandman, who plants a tree, hath right unto the fruit. God therefore, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and planted thee, hath right unto thee and all that thou art. And if his right be ſuch for making thee, it is no leſs for ordaining thee for himſelf. There is no Dominion ſo abſolute, (as both Divines and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers affirm) as that of the End over thoſe things, which are in order to it; in ſo much as <hi>Marcilius
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:51068:254"/>Ficinus</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Mar. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus l. <hi>1.</hi> Epiſ.</note> The end is a Lord more excellent then thoſe things, which as Servants and Miniſters relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. For this reaſon man, although he be neither the Creatour nor utmoſt end of Corporal things, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is their immediate end, and that they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for his uſe, is their Lord, and God, who is the utmoſt end of man and them, is the Lord of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philo</hi> calls the End the head of things. For as a Prince is the abſolute head and Lord of his vaſſals and Kingdom, ſo the End is Lord and head of thoſe things, which have a relation unto it; and therefore man, who is wholly from God and for God, ought not to ſtir a hand or a foot but in order to his ſervice. One of the Philoſophers calls the End The cauſe of cauſes; another, The principal of all cauſes. If therefore unto God, becauſe he is thy efficient cauſe, thou oweſt him what thou art, for being thy final cauſe thou oweſt him more then thou art. For this obligation looks not upon that which thou haſt received, which is thy finite and limited being, but upon that for which thou art ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is a being divine, infinite and without limit. Even God himſelf, as he is the efficient cauſe of things, doth as it were ſerve himſelf, as he is the chief good and Final cauſe of things, and doth not make them but for this end. What right then haſt thou to work for any thing but God, ſince God doth not, nor will work for any thing but himſelf. The End is the cauſe of cauſes; and therefore if thou oweſt thy ſelf unto God for being thy Maker, thou oweſt thy ſelf unto him for being thy End; for he had not been thy Maker, if it had not been for ſome End, which was the cauſe of thy creation.</p>

                     <p>Conſider the force of the End in the ſeveral Orders of things Natural, Artificial, and Moral, that thou maieſt from hence gather what force it ought to have
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:51068:255"/>in things ſupernatural. With what violence do the the Elements tend unto their centre, becauſe it is their End? With what force doth a ſtone fall from high, and with what violence doth it preſs unto its natural place, and bears down all before it? And the fire, that it may attain his Sphere, how it mounts above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hills and rocks? Conſider a great Stone hung in the air by ſome Cable, how it ſtrives to get looſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at liberty with what violence it falls upon the earth, with what ſpeed and earneſtneſs, without ſtay or diverſion to one part or other, it tends ſtraight to its Center. In this manner thou oughteſt to ſeek after thy Lord God, with all the powers of thy ſoul, with all the forces of thy body, and all the affections of thy heart; all thy inclinations are to tend that way: thou art to go directly to him without diverting on either hand, or looking upon any creature, which may detain thee, bearing down all things temporal before thee. A ſtone, that it may attain its end, ſticks not to fall in water, fire, or to be daſht in a thouſaud pieces; and thou, that thou mayeſt attain thy God, art not to ſtop at any thing, not at the loſs of goods, or honour, or at the very tearing of thy members in pieces; and, as our Saviour ſayes, If thy Eye ſcandalize thee, pluck it out, or cut off thy Foot or Hand, if it offend thee; for it is better to enter into heaven blind or lame, then to fall into hell fire ſound and entire. Things natural find no quiet, but in their Centre; and the Mariners needle reſts not but when it beholds the North; no more ſhall the Soul ever meet with repoſe but in God. And certainly the cauſe of the greateſt miſeries and afflictions in the world proceeds from our deviating from God, who is our onely End and eternal happineſs. Let the heart of man therefore undeceive it ſelf; for it ſhall never finde quiet and content but in its Creatour.</p>
                     <p>If we come to things Artificial, Thoſe which are not directed to ſome end, what are they but a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:51068:255"/>confuſion? If a Painter ſhould draw his lines without propoſing any Idea unto himſelf, what would be the iſſue of his work but a great blot? If in painting ſome great Captain, he ſhould inſtead of a Sword place in his hand a Diſtaff, what a ridiculous figure would he make? If a Statuary ſhould give a number of great ſtrokes upon a piece of wood without inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making an Image, he would do nothing but weary himſelf, and ſpoil the wood and his inſtruments. This thou doſt in all thy works, when thou lookeſt not upon God and eternitie as thy end; thou doſt only make a blot of thy life, and looſeſt thy ſelf and thoſe creatures, which thou uſeſt otherwaies then for the obtaining of heaven. God created thee according to his image, to the end thou ſhouldſt perfect that image, and make it every day more like unto thy Creatour. But thou not looking upon him in thy actions, makeſt thy ſelf a monſter, and confoundeſt and bloteſt out his divine Image. Finally as all, which is done in art without order to the end, is errour, ſo all, that thou doſt without looking upon God as thy utmoſt end, is confuſion and perdition of thy ſelf. Reflect then wherein thou mayeſt at laſt conclude: ſince thou haſt ſo often forgotten God and wandred from thy end.</p>
                     <p>If we look upon Moral works or humane actions, When they are not proportioned to their Ends, what are they but madneſs and indiſcretion? for what is madneſs, but a diverſion of things from their end? If one who were deſirous to avoyd cold, ſhould ſtrip himſelf naked, and flie from the fire, would not all ſay this man were mad? and wherein conſiſts his madneſs, but in not fitting things to the end he ayms at. Thou art no wiſer thy ſelf, if deſiring and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy own good and happineſs, thou flyeſt from God, and doeſt not follow him in all thy actions. This, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes, is the errour of man, who naturally loving happineſs, by miſtaking the way to find it, becomes miſerable. Who but a fool or a mad man, fit to
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:51068:256"/>be bound in chains, having great thirſt would fill himſelf with Salt? and yet all this folly conſiſts in nothing but not proportioning the means unto their end. He who is dry ought to go to ſome fountain, and there to quench his thirſt; and man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to eaſe his heart, is to repair unto God, and there he ſhall find reſt. To divert himſelf after the creatures, and there to feed his pleaſures, is no other then to eat Salt, which encreaſes his thirſt and appetite, and ſcorches his Entrails. We are fools therefore in not looking upon God in all our actions, and not ordering them unto him as to our end. He were to be eſteemed a Sot, who being to light a Lamp would fill it with water inſtead of oyle, and yet ſtrive and trouble himſelf to make it burn. Theſe follies we commit every day, when we uſe the Creatures to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends then the ſervice of God; ſo as they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindle in us the fire of his love, nor ſuſtain the luſter and dignity of the reaſonable Soul. From all then which is ſaid it follows, That what is not adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its proper end, is contemptible, monſtrous, and unprofitable. For this reaſon <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>All have declined,</hi> that is, All have wandered from their end, which is God, <hi>and are made unprofitable.</hi> Man therefore, whilſt he ſervs not his Creatour, is a thing vain and ſtands for nothing; and it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him not to be, then not to order himſelf to his end. The Labourer, who hath planted a tree to the end it ſhould bring him fruit, if it yield none, plucks it up by the roots and burns it; And in the Goſpel the barren Figtree was commanded to be cut down.</p>

                     <p>This force of the Final cauſe is ſuch, that things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering themſelves unto it, receive a better being, and a more noble eſtimation from their end, how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:51068:256"/>then from any thing they can attain, which is not their end, though never ſo precious. A Spade receives his value from digging the earth, and for that end is eſteemed and bought by the Labourer; but if you give it a Painter to limm with, he will not allow it a place in his ſhop. The Sick man, whilſt he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, will pay any thing for a bitter purge, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well he hates. Even veſſels for unclean offices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in Corners, are of uſe and ſought for; but ſet upon a Cupboard are a ſcorn. So much it imports things to be accommodated unto their proper End; which how vile and baſe ſoever giv's them eſtimation: but ſevered from it, though they mount unto the Clouds, they looſe their value. Mark then in what condition is that man, who ſeeks not after God, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not his actions unto him, who is ſo high an End. It is alſo to be conſidered, That as there is nothing ſo baſe, which being applyed unto his proper end, hath not ſome good: ſo there is nothing, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoever, which being diverted from his end, looſes not his worth. He, who is ready to die for thirſt, will eſteem a little water out of a ditch more then all the treaſures of the world: ſo <hi>Liſimachus</hi> valued a Jarr of water above his Kingdom. From whence it follows, that it is the End, which gives things their value and eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>Open then thine eyes, and conſider, That thou art not in the world for nothing: That thou wert not created without a Wherefore, and for What; thou haſt an end, and oughteſt to purſue it: and if thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteſt it, thou art worſe then when thou wert not. Thou haſt an End, and the greateſt and moſt high, that can be thought of, which is the glorie of God. Certainly if God had onely created thee to ſerve him without hope to enjoy him, or ever to attain unto his glory, yet thou oughteſt to have eſteemed it highly. The Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> when ſhe beheld the greatneſs,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.</note> wiſdom, and majeſty of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> cryed out with
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:51068:257"/>wonder, Bleſſed are thy Servants, which ſtand here in thy preſence. If this wiſe Lady held it for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ſerve <hi>Salomon,</hi> what an honour and felicity is it to ſerve God? But that infinite goodneſs was not content that thy End ſhould be onely to ſerve, but that thou ſhould paſs ſo farre as to enjoy him, and be partaker of his own bleſſedneſs. In this high End thou art not onely equal unto Angels, but a ſharer with God, who as he hath no other end or bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but himſelf, ſo he would not that thou ſhouldſt have a leſs End or happineſs then thy Creatour. Thou wert born then for a great good, ſince thou wert born ſor the chiefeſt good.<note place="margin">Mal. l. <hi>2.</hi> Sent.</note> Whereupon the Maſter of ſentences ſayes, <q>God created the rational nature, that he might know the chief good, and knowing and loving it might poſſeſs it, and poſſeſſing it enjoy it.</q> God created the Elements for thoſe natures, which have life; He created the hearbs of the field for thoſe creatures, which have ſenſe; Thoſe which have ſenſe for Man: and man for an End, which ſhould ſurpaſs all, as being created, not for an end within nature, but for one above it, a ſupernatural and divine End.

                        <q>Since the dignity of man is ſo great, who is created for ſo excellent an end, the felicity of Angels, and the clear contemplation and fruition of his moſt glorious Creator, Is it not a great ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, baſeneſs, and folly of carnal and wicked men to turn from their God, and not regarding ſo great happineſs, to place their ſelicity in things carnal, tranſitory, vain, baſe and uncleane, that is, in the delights of the fleſh, the riches of the world, and in humane praiſe and glorie? for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſinns mortally, preferrs the Creature before the Creatour, places his end in a thing fraile and created, adhering more unto that then his Maker,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:51068:257"/>which muſt needs be a great injury to God, and a contempt of that felicity, for which he created us.</q> Have this ſtill before thine eyes, That thy End is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the World, ſince it is God, which created the World. Conſider that by how much the honour is greater to be ordained for ſo excellent an end, by ſo much the ignominy is greater to deflect from it. Know therefore thine own worth and dignity, and preſerve it, and direct all thy works and actions to ſo glorious a mark; and ſince God hath created thee for the ſame End with Angels, live like an Angel, and endeavour to fill up their ſeats, and to be a companion of their glory. If is a great priviledge of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that being in ſubſtance inferiour to that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yet it may equal and excel it in happineſs. For God, that the Angels might attain their End, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his grace conformable unto their natures, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more unto the more perfect: but unto Men, he gives his grace without this reſtriction, ſo as man, if he pleaſe, may be more than an Angel.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Philoſophers knew very well the great importance of the End of man, and were therefore very ſollicitous in finding out what it was, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once found it, they might direct the actions of their life unto it. For they ſaid, and truly, That all they did was error, if firſt the end of man, whereunto humane actions might be addreſt, were not known; And therefore <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſaid in his Philoſophy, That they dote,<note place="margin">Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus l. <hi>2.</hi> Philoſ.</note> who propoſe not unto themſelves ſome mark, whereunto they may addreſs all their thoughts and endeavours. But after that they had once agreed, that the end of man was to live confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto his nature, what did not many of them then do to adjuſt their actions, and obtain it? what excellent leſſons, and inſtructions did they leave us? and although the End of man in their opinion did not tranſcend humane nature; yet the Stoicks and Cynicks forſook honours, wealth, and pleaſures, that they
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:51068:258"/>might the better accommodate their lives and actions unto it: living not only without doing ill, but doing, what they thought to be, good, maintaining ſtill, that we ought in all things to conform our ſelves unto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and all this for that natural End, which they had found out;<note place="margin">Philo de Migr. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> Concerning which <hi>Philo</hi> ſpeaks theſe words; <q>The End, ſo celebrated by the moſt excellent Philoſophers, is to live according to nature: and this is done, when the Soul entring by the way of vertue walks in the paths of right reaſon, and follows God, ever mindful of his Commandments, and obſerving them with firmneſs in all his words and actions.</q> If man then ought to do this in order to his natural End, what ought he to do in order to his ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and to Eternity? <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, judging that the End of man was to live according to nature, thought it a great madneſs not to conform himſelf to the accidents of life, and bear them with calmneſs and equality of mind; inſomuch as he ſaid, To do otherwayes was the plague-ſore, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume of the World. What would he have ſaid of committing grievous and deadly ſins, which ſeparate us from God, who is above all nature, and the Author of it? He was ſo ſollicitous in ordering himſelf to this End, that from morning until night all his thoughts were buſied in the contemplation of the End, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was born, and in fitting his actions to comply with it.<note place="margin">M. Aur. Anton. Phil. l. <hi>5.</hi> in princ.</note> Whereupon he gives us this adviſe. <q>In the morning when thou riſeſt, and findeſt thy ſelf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with ſleep and ſloth, have this thought ever in readineſs, that thou riſeſt to exerciſe the actions of a man, and ſhalt therefore ſay unto thy ſelf, Whence comes it, that thou ſo ſluggiſhly goeſt about that, for which thou wert born, and for which thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt into the world? wert thou perhaps born to pamper thy ſelf in a ſoft and warm Bed? This indeed is pleaſing, but wert thou born for thy guſt and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not for labour? ſeeſt thou not how Plants,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:51068:258"/>Spiders, Ants, Bees, and all things employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their proper duties: and thou onely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt to exerciſe the office of a reaſonable man in what appertains unto thy nature? I confeſs ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary; but in this Nature hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a rule, as in eating and drinking; but thou in this paſſeſt what is ſufficient, and in what thou oughteſt to do falleſt ſhort, and reacheſt not unto reaſon. This happens, becauſe thou doeſt not love thy ſelf; for if thou didſt, thou wouldeſt comply with thy nature and her commands. Thoſe Craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who love and take pleaſure in their arts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves ſo ſeriouſly in them, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think of bathing nor feeding; but thou priſeſt not thy nature ſo much as a Turner or Comedian doth his Trade, or a Covetous man his gold, or an Ambitious man his vain glory. For theſe, that they may attain at what they aim, forget both food and ſleep; but thou eſteemeſt the actions, proper to a reaſonable Soul, unworthy of labour or ſollicitude.</q> All this is from that wiſe Emperour, who from the conſideration of his End and Nature animated himſelf to comply with his duty and obligation.</p>

                     <p>From what is ſpoken we are to gather the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are to have of the Eternal, and with what earneſtneſs we are to deſire and ſeek it, ſince it is the End, for which we were only born: and that for it ſelf we are not ſo much as to look at the Temporal, as not being at all ordained for it. But that we may likewiſe ſee what uſe we are to make of it, and the difference ariſing betwixt it and the Eternal, The one being our End, and The other at beſt but our Mean, to obtain it, As we have already declared the nature of the Eternal, ſo we will with as much brevity, as is poſſible, explicate the nature of the Temporal, the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:51068:259"/>which as a Medium hath no other reaſon to be loved or valued by us, but as it conduces to our chief End, which is God and his glory. For as a Souldier, when he is in health, values not the Phyſician and his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, becauſe they avail him not to the conquering of his Enemy: and when he is ſick or hurt, cares not to put on his arms, becauſe they conduce not to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health: In the like manner we are to keep our hearts and wills free and diſinterreſſed from any thing, but that which leads to our End and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Traveller, who is fixt in his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of arriving to ſome certain place, if he meet with two or three ſeveral wayes, deſires not this more than that, but onely in as much as this may more readily bring him to his reſt. He cares not whether it be plain or hilly, whether it lead to the right hand or to the left: all is indifferent, ſo it bring him whither he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. After the like manner we are to behave our ſelves in the uſe of things temporal. We are neither to love the Goods of this World, nor fear the Evils of it: but free from both, make onely choice of that which leads to our Salvation. If poverty bring thee to God, imbrace it with both arms and eſteem it; If riches and greatneſs withdraw thee from him, trample them under foot, deſpiſe and caſt them from thee, as if they were poiſon; If diſgraces and neglect of men aſſiſt thee to gain Heaven, rejoyce in thy affronts; If honours make thee forget thy Creator, abhorre them as death; If pleaſures diſtract thee from him, unto whom thou oweſt ſo much, deprive thy ſelf of the contents of this life, that thou mayeſt not loſe thoſe of the other; And if grief or torments make thee know thy Redeemer, receive them with all ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and willingneſs. Wherefore thou art neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or abhorre good or evil in this life, but in as much as it unites or ſeparates thee from God, who is thy true and onely End. This indifferency was well known unto <hi>David,</hi> as he is explicated by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:51068:259"/>in that Pſalm, which he entitles and dedicates Unto the <hi>End,</hi> where he conſiders himſelf as created by God for ſo high an End as to ſerve and enjoy him. upon which ſuppoſition he utters this Sentence; <hi>As are his darkneſs, ſo is his light;</hi>

                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.</note> becauſe we are no more to encline our affections to the luſtre and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of this life, than to the obſcurity, ignominy, and afflictions; no more to the light and proſperity, than to the darkneſs and adverſity of it; and therefore the holy Father ſpeaks in this manner; <q>In this night, In this mortality of humane life men enjoy both light and darkneſs. Light is proſperity, and darkneſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. But when Chriſt our Saviour ſhall come and inhabit the Soul by Faith, and ſhall promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other light, and ſhall inſpire and endow man with patience, and ſhall ſo move him as not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with proſperity, nor dejected with adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, The faithful man ſhall then begin to uſe this world with indifferency, and ſhall not be puffed up, when things ſucceed happily, nor broken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, when they fall out croſly, but ſhall bleſs God in all conditions, Whether he abound or want, Whether he be ſick or in health, and ſhall be ever ready to ſing this Song: <hi>I will bleſs the Lord at all times; his praiſe ſhall be ever in my mouth.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another condition of the Medium, which is either the ſame that we have ſpoken of, or united unto it, is, That we are not to enjoy the Medium, but onely to uſe it: For in enjoying the Soul reſts and contents it ſelf, which is proper to the End; but in the uſe it ayms at the attaining ſomething further, which is proper to the Medium. We are therefore not to ſeek after any creature, but in as much as it may be a Means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our End, which is the Creator; and he, who ſeeks after things temporal for themſelves, does no leſs an injury unto God, than to change baſely his End, leaving the Eternal for the Temporal, and the Creator for the Creature, and becomes ſo much a Sot and a Fool,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:51068:260"/>as he miſtakes his true End, and makes the Medium his End, and ſubmits himſelf to a vile Creature. From whence may be underſtood that difference betwixt things, which is noted by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and Divines, that ſomethings are to be enjoyed, and others onely made uſe of. We are onely to enjoy the Eternal, and uſe the Temporal onely ſo far as may help to ſave us, and no further. For, as the ſame Saint ſaith, The vicious life of man is no other, than that which he uſes ill, and that which he enjoyes ill; and to the contrary the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laudable life of the good is that which uſes this World aright, and enjoyes God aright. From hence alſo may be reſolved that doubt amongſt the ancient Philoſophers, Which are the true goods, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was alſo on foot amongſt the faithful in <hi>David's</hi> time. Wherefore he demands in one of his Pſalms; <hi>Quis oſtendit nobis bona? Who will ſhew us the good things?</hi> This doubt is reſolved, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is given to the queſtion: That thoſe are the Goods, which unite us unto God, and thoſe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evil, which ſeparate us from him.

                        <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, that the chiefeſt wiſdom was to diſtinguiſh good from evil.

                     <p>But we are much to conſider, that the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe of the Creatures for the attaining unto the Creator is the contempt of them. God would have it ſo eaſie for thee to obtain thy End, that thou couldeſt not miſs the means, ſince even the want of all things may further thee. Let no man therefore complain of the neceſſities of life, ſince, though all things fail him, the means of his ſalvation will not fail him; for even that want may be a means to obtain it. If thou ſhalt therefore fall into ſuch a poverty, as thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuſtain thee, if it conduce to thy ſalvation, think thy ſelf the happieſt man in the world, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with a hundred hands; for as all things, which hinder us from our end, are to be contemned, ſo whatſoever helps us to the obtaining of it, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be grief, pain, or death it ſelf,) is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed above all value. So great a matter it is to be a means of thy ſalvation, that Chriſt our Lord, who is the beginning and end of all things, diſdained it not himſelf: incarnating, dying, and remaining for that end in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of his Body and Blood. And if it coſt the Son of God ſo dear to be a means of thy ſalvation, do not thou ſtick at any thing (how horrible ſoever it appear to humane nature) that may advance and ſecure it, but eſteem it as a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, though it be infamy, ſhame, or diſhonor.</p>
                     <p>Thou travelleſt towards Heaven; that's the end of thy journey. Make thy voyage ſecure, whatſoever it coſt thee. He who goes for the <hi>Indies,</hi> if he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark

Take the certaineſt way for Heaven; and believe me, there is none more ready, then that of the Croſs of Chriſt, his Humility, and Mortification. In all things thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt ſtill the beſt for thy ſelf. Know there is nothing better, or more imports thee than a good life. Make it then a good one: and content not thy ſelf with this which thou now liveſt, if thou canſt make it better; and no way more ready &amp; available to improve it, than by imitating the life of thy Redeemer, to deſpiſe all that is Temporal. This is the moſt proper and certain way of obtaining the Eternal, whereunto thou art to aſpire, and for which thou were born. Have ſtill thy end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes; for thou erreſt ſo often as thou doeſt not behold it, and canſt not erre without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.<note place="margin">St. Greg. Iſid. Clar.</note> Many compare this life unto a high and narrow Bridge, ſo narrow that it is ſcarce broad enough for our feet: and if we fall, we precipitate into a filthy Lake, where .Serpents and Dragons wait to devour us, And who being to paſs ſuch a Bridge in an obſcure and dark night, having no other guide to direct him but a little light placed in the end of the Bridge, durſt for one inſtant remove his eyes from it? In the like condition are we. This life is a ſtraight Bridge, over which we are to paſs in the night and darkneſs of this world. We cannot come off ſafely in this dangerous paſſage without ſtill looking at our end, and at that divine light, which enlightens our Souls. Let not our eyes wander from it, leſt we fall into that Gulph, and periſh for all eternity. This perdition <hi>David</hi> ſignified in the Title, which he gave unto his 13. Pſalm, which he calls <hi>For the End,</hi> where he ſayes, That thoſe who look not upon God as their utmoſt End, making no more account of him than if he were not, That ſuch became abominable and corrupted in their intentions: That there was not one amongſt them, who did well: That all became vain and unprofitable, and failed in
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:51068:261"/>their thoughts, words, and actions: That their mouths were as peſtilential as an open ſepulcher, which none could endure for the ſtench of worms and corruption: That the poiſon of Aſps was in their lips, and deceit and bitterneſs in their mouths: That all their wayes were wickedneſs, and That therefore their feet ran ſwiftly to ſhed blood: That their hearts were full of fearful imaginations, and That they trembled where there was nothing to fear; finally, That all their courſes were nothing but ruine, and unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: That they did not invoke and pray unto the Lord: That they knew not the wayes of peace: That the fear of God was not before their eyes. All this, which <hi>David</hi> deciphers, happened, as he ſaith, unto this wicked people, becauſe they had not God in their hearts, nor did propoſe him as the end of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And truly from this defect ſprings all that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. For without God there is neither quiet, peace, nor vertue; for true peace conſiſts in ſeeking nothing but God, and for God. In this conſiſts the liberty of the ſons of God, the contempt of the World, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the Minde, and the conformity with the Will of God. And moſt certainly the foundation of all vertue is to know that we are born for nothing but the ſervice of God; and ſo forget it, as the wicked do, is (as <hi>David</hi> ſayes) a certain kind of Atheiſm, making us live, as if there were no God, in looſeneſs of manners without prayer, and without the quiet and repoſe of the Soul. To theſe three heads the Prophet reduces the diſorders of thoſe, who think not of their chief End, nor remember that there is a God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he, who to the contrary ſhall ſtill fix his thoughts upon that whereunto he is ordained, ſhall be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vertuous Cuſtoms, fervour, and frequency of prayer, and poſſeſs the quiet and peace of minde. For as the Iron touched by the Loadſtone reſts not until it reſpect the North, no more ſhall a heart ever enjoy repoſe but in beholding his chief and utmoſt End, which is God.</p>

                     <p> By the knowledge of our ſelves way be known the uſe of things Temporal, and the little eſteem we are to wake of them.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEfore we paſs further I muſt here advertiſe you of a point of great importance, which is, that for the right uſe of things the knowledge of the things themſelves, and the end whereunto they ſerve is not ſufficient; but there is required alſo a knowledge of the perſon, who is to uſe them. It is not enough for the wiſe Phyſician to know the uſe and property of his Medicaments, unleſs he know the nature and quality of his Patient, his temper, ſtrength, age, and other circumſtances, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them he may adminiſter his Remedies. And therefore having ſhewn the End of man to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and that the things of this world are onely to be uſed as means to obtain it, we ſhall now for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of this matter ſpeak ſomething of the eſtate and quality of Man, as he now is, that he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know what uſe of things temporal is moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him.</p>
                  <p>Humane nature is at the preſent in a far different condition from that wherein it was, when God at firſt created man, and placed him in Paradiſe; ſo as a farr different uſe of things temporal from that, which was then lawful and convenient, is now to be required. And therefore it is fit that we know what Man is, that we may acertain the uſe of Man, and the things of Man, which cannot be done without the knowledge of what he is in general, and alſo that every one know what he himſelf is in particular.<note place="margin">Dion Chryſ. Orat. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> And therefore <hi>Dion Chryſoſtomus</hi> is ſayes, He, who knows not Man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:51068:262"/>make uſe of Man: and he, who knows not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, cannot make uſe of himſelf, nor of thoſe things which belong unto his nature. But who can arrive unto the knowledge of himſelf? It is ſo difficult, that the Devil, although he knew how important this knowledge was to Man, and wiſht nothing but his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and perdition, yet confident in the impoſſibility of attaining it, and deſirous to gain the credit of a wife God among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he cauſed this Command, <hi>Know thy ſelf,</hi> to be placed in his Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos.</hi> And truly the light of Heaven is neceſſary for this knowledge; and we guided by what faith dictates, and the Saints inctruct us, will endeavour to ſay ſomething, whereby we may at leaſt be leſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what we are. It is then to be conſidered What Man is of himſelf, and what he is of God, that is, what he hath of himſelf, and what he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God. What he hath from God muſt needs be good, ſince he gave it, from whom can proceed no ill. And if upon this ſcore, becauſe it is good, he hath leſs ground to humble himſelf, I am ſure he hath none to boaſt of, ſince it is wholly the Divine benefit, not having any thing of himſelf, but what he hath received. Onely he may conſider, that by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> he hath put himſelf in a worſe condition both for ſoul and body, than when he received them from God. His Soul is now full of ignorance and imbecility to what is good, and ſubject to a thouſand miſeries, which it then had not; And his Body, which is now mortal, was then immortal, and free from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe infirmities, which (as hath been already ſaid) accompany it, until it end in duſt, worms, and aſhes. But theſe (although by the perverſeneſs of our nature they are become much worſe) yet coming from God are good, and are ah honour and glory in reſpect; of what he poſſeſſes from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Council declares in two words, that is, We are nothing of our ſelves but a Lye and Sin;
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:51068:263"/>that is the nothing that we were, and the evil we are. A lye we are: becauſe what is a lye, is not; And from our ſelves we have onely a not being; for what have we but what God hath given us? take away what we have received, and there remains nothing. This is what is ours: what is more, is our Creators; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to uſe it according to our own fancy, but his pleaſure. Thou art alſo to conſider, that thou oughteſt to humble thy ſelf more for being nothing, than for being but duſt and aſhes. For thoſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and betwixt ſomething and nothing there is no proportion, and, as the Philoſophers ſay, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance. Thou haſt not from thy ſelf ſo much as a poſſibility of being; for if God were not God, thou couldeſt not have been at all. From this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thou haſt great reaſon to humble thy ſelf. For to be nothing is a Well without bottom never to be drawn drie: yet this Nothing is far better than what thou art by Sin. Here the moſt holy Saints have ſunk down in amazement, and ſome unto whom our Lord hath revealed what they are, have been ſo aſtoniſhed, as they had certainly died, if they had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and upheld by the Divine hand. For having ſinned thou art as evil as ſin it ſelf. Call to mind what we have ſaid of the infinite malice and abomination of ſin. All this falls upon him who commits it, With reaſon therefore did <hi>Dion</hi> the Philoſopher ſay, That it was moſt hard to know ones ſelf: becauſe it was moſt hard to comprehend the malice of ſin, which being the chiefeſt evil becomes in a manner as difficult to be known as the chiefeſt good: and therefore no better way to find what it is, than to proceed after the ſame way we do in the knowledge of God.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> teaches us, that in the knowledge of God we may proceed alter two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:51068:263"/>either by the way of Affirmation, attributing unto God all what is Good and perfect: or by way of Negation, denying unto him all what is good or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Creatures, as being of a goodneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection infinitly above it. In the ſame manner we are to proceed in the knowledge of Sin, either by Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in attributing unto it all the ill in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever, or by Negation, denying it any ill, as being a malice of another kind, horrible and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, above all other Evils imaginable. Call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore all the evils thou haſt ſeen, heard, or read of; Joyn all theſe in one; a mortal ſin is worſe then all theſe together. The miſeries of <hi>Job,</hi> ſtilence in the time of <hi>David,</hi> the torments of <hi>Phalaris, Nero, Diocleſian,</hi> and all the Tyrants are farre ſhort of it in malice. Is it as bad, as all thoſe afflictions and miſeries, which they ſuffered, who periſhed in the Deluge, and thoſe who were burnt alive in <hi>Sodome</hi> and the neighbouring Towns, and as all they ſuffered, who were put to the ſword in <hi>Amalee,</hi> and all thoſe that were hunger-ſtarved in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> One onely mortal ſin goeth far beyond all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid miſeries. All the Plagues, Warrs, Sickneſs, Famines, all, that hath been ſuffered ſince the World began, come not near the ill of one ſin. Good God! how vaſt is that evil, which is equivalent to ſo many evils? where ſhall we find an evil that may equal it? where ſhall we meet with an end of ſo much malice? Certainly all the evils, that have been ſince the World began, or could ſucceed in a million of Worlds to come, fall ſhort of it. If nothing then upon earth be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto it, let us ſeek it beneath the earth amongſt thoſe eternal evils, which ſhall never have end. Let us enter Hell, and conſider the torments there, which are or have been ſuffered by Men or Devils even from the leaſt and moſt unknown of the damned unto <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Is there any thing there, that may equal, the evil of one ſin? No; we ſhall not there, find it.
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:51068:264"/>Reflect, I ſay again, and mark if thou findeſt any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt ſo many miſerable creatures, as ſuffer in Hell, which may parallel the malice of one only mortal ſin. There is none to be found. But I'le give thee leave to make a collection of thoſe many torments, which may ſeem unto thee in reaſon comparable to a mortal ſin, and you ſhall finde that Sin does not onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize, but exceed the malice of them. Joyn then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and put in one heap all the torments that are inflicted upon all damned creatures, Men and Angels, and compare the malice of them all with that one of mortal ſin, and you ſhall find that the malice of ſin doth farr ſurpaſs the malice of all thoſe. That gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, that inconſolable weeping, that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, which penetrates the bowels for all eternity, all that our imagination can frame, reaches not ſo immenſe an evil. If we cannot therefore finde the depth of the malice of ſin by way of Affimation, let us try what may be done by the other way of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this will alſo fail us. For the evil of plagues, famine, and death are not it; A mortal ſin is more then theſe. The evils of poverty, diſhonour, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not it: It is more then theſe. The torments of hell are not it; It is above hell and all the pains of it. Think with thy ſelf that all the atoms, which are to be found in the air, all the ſands in the ſea, all the leaves on the trees, all the graſs in the fields, all the ſtarrs in the heavens, think, I ſay, that they are foul and ugly bodies, all moſt deformed Monſters, and frame to thy ſelf a Monſter and ugly Creature, which ſhould be made of all theſe: will this equalize the foulneſs of a mortal ſin? It is not this ugly Monſter, nor this foul deformed Creature: but it is a foulneſs and uglineſs, that doth far ſurpaſs all theſe, and all horrid ſhapes and figures imaginable. And let not this ſeem ſtrange unto thee; For not onely the evil of a Mortal ſin, but even that of a Venial is greater than all the evils of Hell, or the evils within or without it; all tht mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſueſs,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:51068:264"/>all the deformity of all things, that are or can be contracted into one, do not equal it; Sin is more than all. And therefore as St. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſaid of God, That he was above what was good, or what was fair, becauſe his goodneſs and beauty were of a ſuperiour kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So it may be ſaid of ſin; It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deformity, abomination, horror, or malice, but is ſomething more than all theſe.</p>
                     <p>Let a ſinner therefore know himſelf, and that he is by ſin above all that is ugly, foul, or monſtrous. For as he, that hath whiteneſs, is as white as that which makes him ſo, ſo he, that is in ſin, is as horrible and ill as ſin it ſelf. Let him then reflect whether he is to ſink charged with ſuch a guilt, and how much he ought to abhorr and loath himſelf. Certainly if he ſhould ſink into Hell, he would there finde no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worſe then himſelf. If he ſhould return into the Abyſs of nothing, he would be there better, then in that Abyſs of malice, which is in ſin. Let him then reflect whether ſo unworthy and vile a wretch ought to have the ſame uſe of the creatures, as if he were in the ſtate of innocency, and without this ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of ſin. Let him conſider if a perſon ſo infamous, ſo abhominable as himſelf ought to uſe the things of this world for his delight, honour, pomp, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation. The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> Lord of the world, and poſſeſſor of the greateſt honours it could give him, though a Gentil, yet thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo worthy of contempt, that he writes in this manner; "Treat thy ſelf, O ſoul with ignominy,<note place="margin">Anton. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> "and deſpiſe thy ſelf; For thou haſt no title to honour. It is a prodigious thing, that he, who hath committed a mortal ſin, ſhould deſire honour and reſpect: That he ſhould complain of the troubles of this life, and deſire to be cheriſhed and made much of: That he, who is the ſhame and infamy of the world, ſhould gape after glory: That he who is a Traytor to his God, ſhould wiſh to be honoured and reſpected. He
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:51068:265"/>who hath deſerved hell for an eternitie, why ſhould he grumble at a ſhort ſickneſs or the neceſſities of this life, which if he make the right uſe of, may ſerve as a means of his ſalvation? Let him therefore, who hath ſinned, know that he is not to make the ſame uſe of the creatures, as if he were innocent; he is not to aim at other honour, then that of God; he is not to ſeek after eaſe and the Commodities of life, but the ſecuritie of his ſalvation: not to thirſt after the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, but to perform ſtrict penances for his ſins paſt. O if one knew himſelf perfectly, with what different eyes would he behold the things of the world? he would look upon them as things not appertaining to him at all; and if he did not deſpiſe them, at leaſt he would make no account of them. The Son of God, onely becauſe he took upon him the form of a ſinner, would not uſe the goods of this life, but rather imbraced all that was troubleſome, painful, and bitter in it. why ſhould he then, who is really and in ſubſtance a ſinner, ſeek honours and delights? Let him know the means of his ſalvation, ſince Chriſt himſelf hath taught them, to wit, Penance, Mortification, and the Croſs. If Chriſt, becauſe he bore the ſins of others, uſed not temporal goods and the Commodities of life, why ſhould man, who is loaden with his own ſins, complain he wants the pleaſures and conveniences of it? Why ſhould he gape after the goods of the earth, who is infected with a greater evil then that of hell? The admirable man, bleſſed <hi>Francis Borgia,</hi> the great deſpiſer of himſelf and the world, out of this conſideration was moſt content in the tribulations and want of all things temporal: and the leaſt comfort in his greateſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities ſeemed too much for him. All men wondered to ſee him ſo poor, and the incommodities he ſuffered in his travail, when he viſited the Colledges of the Society in <hi>Spain.</hi> Amongſt the reſt a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, amazed at his great pains and ſufferance, ſaid
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:51068:265"/>unto him, Father how is it poſſible, that having been ſo great a Lord you can endure the troubles and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of the wayes? To whom the ſervant of God anſwered; Sir, do not pity me; for I alwayes ſend before me a Harbinger, who provides plentifully for all things neceſſary. This Harbinger was the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, which in his greateſt neceſſities made what he had appear too plentiful.</p>

                     <p>Beſides this, he who hath ſinned ought to Conſider, that he hath need of Gods holy hand to draw him out of that miſery, or, if he be already by repentance freed, to preſerve him from falling again into it; That the means to obtain this is not the pride of the world, the riches of the earth, or the pleaſures of the fleſh, but faſting, ſackcloth, humiliation and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Let him remember that of himſelf he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to that nothing hath added ſin; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing he can do nothing that is good: and that by ſin he hath diſobliged him, who only could aſſiſt him in doing good. Man is of himſelf nothing but a Lye, and Sin, two horrid and profound Abyſſes. Let him imitate <hi>David</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I cried unto thee, O Lord, from the deeps:</hi> what other deeps, then thoſe two of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and of Sin, which have no bottom? Let him then, who hath once offended his Creator, know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and where he remains. Let him pray, ſigh, and crie from his nothing, and from the depth of his miſerie, that he may be heard of his God. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for him, who is in the condition of a penitent and to demand mercy, it is not ſeemly to uſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, to imploy himſelf in vanities, to take delight in the world, enjoy the Creatures, and ſeek after greatneſs. And although it were lawful in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of nature, when man was free from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, to uſe the Creatures with more libertie, yet
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:51068:266"/>being now fallen, it is no wayes tolerable: but let him look upon himſelf as one guilty, who hath offended his God, and is in fine a miſerable man.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſophers, who conſidered nature, not as it was by ſin, but as it ought to be in it ſelf, meaſured there vertues by that rule, and therefore knew not the vertue of humility, nor uſed that of penance; And the vertues of Magnanimity, Conſtancy, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence they extended ſo far, that many actions, which the Stoicks and Peripateticks called vertuous, may be eſteemed vicious. But the horribleneſs of ſin and the weakneſs of humane nature being now diſcovered, the eſtate of things is changed, and humilitie ought ſtill to reign both in our ſouls and bodies: and many acts of other vertues eſteemed by them are to be corrected. We are to chooſe different Mediums for the advancing our End from thoſe of the Philoſophers, both becauſe the ends we aym at are not the ſame, and becauſe we know our ſelves to be in a far other condition then they imagined. The End propoſed by the Philoſophers was meerly natural, to wit, the Happineſs and felicity of this life. The eſtate of humane nature they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be free, and uncontaminated by ſin, and that it had ſuffcient force of it ſelf to do good. In all this they were deceived; and it is not therefore ſtrange, if for the obtaining of their ends they taught wayes diſtinct from thoſe of Chriſtians, who know their end to be ſupernatural, to wit, the happineſs not of this, but of the other life: who know alſo their eſtate of nature not to be free and entire as it was at firſt, but corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defaced by ſin, and that of it ſelf it hath neither force, nor efficacy to execute any thing that is good, unleſs aſſiſted by the grace and mercy of God. It is therefore no marvail, if Chriſitians, who know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their end, and condition, make uſe of ſuch Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Mediums as the Philoſophers knew not. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it much that the Philoſophers took ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous acts for vices, ſince they miſtook many vices for
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:51068:266"/>vertues. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Prince of natural and moral Philoſophers knew not Humility, voluntary Povertie, and Penance to be vertues, but rather condemned the laſt to be a kind of inſenſibility, and one of thoſe vices contrary to the vertue. of temperance. The Stoicks alſo held Pity and Commiſeration for a vice. But ſince the Goſpel of Chriſt theſe are become the moſt neceſſary and recommended vertues, and the moſt apt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy means for the obtaining of our ſalvation. Theſe three vertues, in which conſiſts the contempt of all things temporal, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew not, becauſe he knew not himſelf. By Humilitie Honours are deſpiſed, by Poverty Riches, and by Penance the Pleaſures and Regaloes of the world. And therefore he who will make the right and profitable uſe of things temporal for the gaining of eternity, muſt as a ſinner humble himſelf, and do penance, muſt not employ, himſelf and the time of his life in gathering and heaping up riches, which are ſo farre from being goods, that to innumerable perſons they have ſhut up the gates of the true and real goods, which are onely the eternal, unto which we are wholly to aſpire, not truſting in our own forces, but in the mercy and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

The gaining of eternity is a matter of ſo high concernement, that the Son of God, to the end we might obtain it. was incarnate and made man; and that we might deſpiſe things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:51068:267"/>is alſo of ſo great importance, that for it it was convenient that Chriſt our Redeemer ſhould ſuffer and die. I know not what can raiſe in us a higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the greatneſs of the one, and baſeneſs of the other, then theſe high and ſtupendious acts of God Almighty. And therefore (though briefly) we will ſay ſomething of them both, beginning with that admirable and great myſtery of the Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>Great is all that which is eternal, and ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us, that rather than we ſhould loſe it God wrought a work of that height and love as amazed the Angels. In which we will conſider four things: The greatneſs of the work, The manner of putting it in execution, The evils from which it frees us, and The good we gain by it. For the firſt, which is the Greatneſs of the work, we are to ſuppoſe the eſtate of man, as he then ſtood; which was the moſt miſerable, infamous, and wretched condition that could be imagined. He was become a ſlave ſo the Devil, polluted with ſin, condemned unto eternal punniſhment, enemy to God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of remedy. For even the higheſt Seraphins could not imagin, that without prejudice to the Juſtice of God it was poſſible for man to be redeemed from that miſerable and ignominious eſtate. For although all the men in the world ſhould ſuffer a thouſand deaths, and all the orders of holy Angels in heaven ſhould offer themſelves in ſacrifice, and ſhould ſuffer eternal torments in hell, all would not ſatisfy for one mortal ſin. All created remedies were then impoſſible; and although God ſhould have created ſome more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and holy creature than the moſt high Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, yet that and they were inſufficient to appeaſe the divine juſtice incenſed againſt man. what remedy then, where none was to be had? what hope, when all was deſpaire? Certainly from what was, or could be created it was impoſſible: and from the Creator it was not known to be poſſible; and if it was known to be poſſible, who could hope that the offended par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:51068:267"/>ty ſhould ſatisfie for the offence committed againſt himſelf? that the Creditor ſhould pay what the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ought? What hope then of remedy, when all hope failed both from Heaven and Earth? The onely remedy, and that onely known to God, was, that God without prejudice to his juſtice might cover man with his mercy: but that much to the coſt of God himſelf, and the greateſt work, whereunto his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdome could extend. But who could think he would imploy ſo great a work for his Enemy? that he would let up the reſt of his omnipotency for him, who was a Traytor to his Lord? Onely this way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for God to make himſelf man, the moſt great and ſtupendious work poſſible or imaginable. But who could believe this ſhould be done for man, ſo vile a creature, made of a little earth, and of ſo ſmall importance to God? This was a work to be reſerved for God himſelf, if his own divinity, life, or ſalvation (if it were poſſible) ſhould come in queſtion; let it be lawful to ſpeak in this manner, to expreſs in ſome ſort that, which is inexplicable, and to ſet forth this ineffable myſtery, and the incomprehenſſible good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. But to do this for the life of a Traytor, for the ſalvation of a Faith-breaker, to advance an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who could once hope or dare to imagin it? If man for the ſervice of God had, as a faithfull ſervant, hazarded his perſon, and run himſelf into that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable and ſad condition, it might have been preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God out of his goodneſs and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would have ſtretched his power for his freedom; but that man having rob'd God of his honour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned him, and made himſelf equal unto him, and that God ſhould yet after all this humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for him, debaſe himſelf ſo low as to be made man, and that for his Enemy, who could think it? But ſuch is the goodneſs of God that he overcame our hopes with his benefits, and did that for us, which would have onely ſufficed for himſelf, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:51068:268"/>he could have done no more. O moſt ſtupendious love of God! O moſt immenſe charitie of our Creator, who ſo much loved man, that he ſtuck not to do what he could for him! O ineffable goodneſs, which would diſcharge that debt, which his enemy owed! O di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nobleneſs, that would ſo much to his own coſt do good to man, from whom he had received ſo much evil! To redeem man, though it had coſt him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, had been much; but at ſo great a rate, who could imagin it? But the thoughts of God are farr different from thoſe of men.</p>

                     <p>Let us now look upon the Greatneſs of this work: great after divers manners; great by the humbling of God ſo much below himſelf, great in it ſelf, ſo great, as the omnipotent power of God could work no greater. Here the divine Attributes were drawn dry. For (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes) neither God could do a greater work, nor knew how to determin it better: there was found the bottom of the whole omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God: for a greater work then this was neither poſſible nor imaginable. For as nothing greater then God is poſſible, ſo no work can poſſibly be greater then that, whereby man is made God. See then what thou oweſt him for this exceſs of favour, that being his Enemy he did all for thee, that his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency could, that his wiſdome knew, or his divine goodneſs and love could will. All his Attributes thy Creator employed for thy good; imploy thou all thy powers in his ſervice. God did all he could for thee; do thou all thou canſt for him. He wrought the work of thy redemtion with all his forces and omnipotency; do thou then with all thy power and forces obſerve his divine will and pleaſure, loving and ſerving him in all things. Seeſt thou not here his infinite love and goodneſs made apparent and laid down before thine
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:51068:268"/>eyes? doeſt thou yet doubt to love him with all thy powers and faculties, who loved thee with all his omnipotency? See what a love was this, when he did that for thee being his enemy, greater than which he could not do for his friend: nor for himſelf, if his own glory were at ſtake. Seeſt thou not clearly his infinite goodneſs, that overcame ſo infinite a malice, man not being able to do a work againſt God of ſo ſtupendious wickedneſs, but God would do a work for man of a more ſtupendious goodneſs, not ſuffering his divine goodneſs to be overcome by humane malice. God ſaw that man did a work ſo profoundly evil, that there could not poſſible be a worſe: for nothing can be ſo bad as mortal ſin. He therefore determined to do a work ſo infinitely good, that in goodneſs it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be a better; and this for accurſed Thee. what ſayeſt thou to it? What ſayeſt thou to ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing bounty, To ſuch an exceſs of love? Hear what the Apoſtle ſayes. <hi>If thy Enemy be a hungred,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ad Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>11.</hi>

Yield thy ſelf then vanquiſhed, and bluſh that thou loveſt him not better then the Angels. Thy eſtate was not onely neceſſitated by hunger and thirſt, but thou waſt plunged into eternal miſerie, and want of all things that were good, deprived of glory and eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. If then to beſtow a bit of bread, or a Cup of water upon a neceſſitated enimie be ſufficient to call colour into his face, and are as coals to enflame him in love and charitie: What is it for God to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his Divinity unto man, and to have given his life for him, when he was his Enemy? How comes not this to make us bluſh for ſhame, and ſet us afire in his divine love? Theſe benefits are not to be coals, but flames, which ought to kindle in us the fire of true love and charitie. Give thy ſelf then for
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:51068:269"/>overcome, and love that divine goodneſs, which for thee being the worſt of all his Creatures did the beſt work of his omnipotency. O nobleneſs of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, O divine ſenſe of honour, (that I may ſo ſpeak)! Man had overcome all works good or bad in malice; but ſuch was the immenſe goodneſs of God, that he would not ſuffer man to do a work ſo exceſſive in evil, but he would do a work for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of traitorous and falſe man more exceſſive in good. Wherefore O Lord did'ſt thou not this, when the Angels ſinned, who were better then man? What goodneſs is this, that thou forbeareſt ſo fowl a ſinner? Is it perhaps that thy work might appear the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Wouldeſt thou expect until man had firſt ſet up his reſt in impudence and malice, that thou mighteſt then ſet up thy reſt in mercy and goodneſs? Who ſees not here, O Lord, the infinitneſs of thy love, and the immenſeneſs of thy bounty?</p>
                     <p>After all manners this excellent work proclaims thy exceſs of bounty, becauſe it is after all manners infinitly good, and opens as many parts to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of our ſouls to adore and admire thee. For this work is not onely infinitely good in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in each particular circumſtance. In it ſelf it is infinitly good. For no work can be better than that which makes man ſo good, as it makes him God. It is good becauſe by it the Divinity is communicated unto a creature, and, which is more, unto the loweſt, and moſt vile of thoſe who are capable of reaſon. For as it is the propertie of what is good to be comunicative, ſo here we ſee the infinite goodneſs of God, who wholly, and all what he is iſſues forth of himſelf, and is communicated unto man. Who is not amazed, that the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which the eternal Father communicates unto the eternal Word, who is God as he is, ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an admirable manner be communicated unto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, which was enemy unto him? O Sea of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:51068:269"/>divine goodneſs, that thus powreſt forth thy ſelf to do good without regarding unto whom! O Ocean of bounty, that thus overfloweſt in benefits even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thine enemies! This work is likewiſe infinitly good, becauſe with goodneſs it overcoms an infinitly malice, and frees him, who was ſo evil, that he deſerved an infinit puniſhment. It is infinitly good, becauſe it ſets forth God with an infinit deſire to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and do good even unto the greateſt Traytour, and who leaſt deſerved it. It ſhewes him alſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly good and compleat in all vertue and perfection, that rather then to fail the leaſt jot in his Juſtice, he would take upon him that which was due unto a moſt unjuſt and accurſed offender, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto death, that he, who was condemned to die, ſhould not periſh eternally. I know not any thing; that can ſet forth God as a more exact and perfect pattern of all vertue, then a work of ſo much Juſtice and Mercy. Who would not be amazed at the goodneſs and piety of a great Emperour, who having a deſire to pardon a notorious Traytour, ſhould rather, then abate one jot of his inflexible juſtice, take upon him the habit and ſhape of that Traytour, and die publiqnely in the market place, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender might be ſpared? This did God, taking upon him the form of a Servant, and dying upon the Croſs to free condemned man from eternal death. O God every way moſt perfect and good, which art ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in thy juſtice, and ſo indulgent in thy mercy: rigorous with thy ſelf, that thou mighteſt be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful with us. O God infinitly good, infinitly holy, infinitely exact and perfect in all / Let the Angels praiſe thee for all thy perfections, ſince all are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and infinitely good.</p>

                     <p>To this maybe added the excellent Manner, by
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:51068:270"/>which a work every way ſo excellently good was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and with what love and deſire of thy benefit it was wrought. From whence could a work of ſo much goodneſs iſſue, but from a furnace of love in the divine breſt? And if by the effect we may know the cauſe, that love, which made God reſolve upon a work ſo admirable ſtrange and high, could not be other then immenſe in it ſelf; for ſince the work was infinitly good, it could not proceed but from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love: nor that love but from an infinite being. Beſides this, it was a great prerogative and honour to humane nature, that God ſhould rather make himſelf a man than an Angel. With being an Angel he might have freed Man, and honoured the Angels, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his divine goodneſs unto the Creatures, and done a work of infinite bounty and favour. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he was ſo paſſionate a lover of man, and, (if I may ſo ſay) ſo fond of humane nature, that he would not onely oblige man by redeeming him. but in the manner of his redemption; he would not only that Man ſhould be redeemed, but that he ſhould be redeemed by a Man, and ſo would not onely give the remedy, but conferre alſo the honour upon our nature. Neither was he content in honouring man more than Angels, but would redeem him, and not the Angels. This was a demonſtration of his affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man beyond all expreſſion, that not pardoning the Angels, who were of a more excellent and ſupream being then ours, he yet took pitie of us, and not of them, and would do that for us, which he did not for them. Unto this add, that, when Man ſinned, and the whole ſtock of mankind was ruin'd, there remained no juſt man to commiſerate and intercede for him. But when the Angels fell, there remained thouſands righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, who might pitie thoſe of their own nature, and be ſenſible of their loſs; and yet he would do this for Man and not for Angels. The time alſo, when this great work of mercy was put in execution, ſhews not a
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:51068:270"/>little the ſweetneſs of God Almighty to our nature. It was in a time, when mankind was moſt forgetful of God: when men ſtrove to make themſelves adored for Gods, and thoſe, who could not attain unto it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, adored other men worſe then devils. Then did God think of making himſelf Man, and for Man, who would make himſelf God. This was a love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to do moſt for us then, when we moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee what good we received by this great work. Certainly if we had received no good at all, it was much to free us from thoſe evils, whereunto we were plunged: to deliver us from the ignominy of Sin, from the ſlavery of the Devil, and from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Hell. To free us from theſe evils without any other benefit might be held an infinite good. And though there had been no evils to be freed from, nor goods to be beſtowed upon us, yet the honour, which our nature received in having God to become one of us, was an incomparable bleſſing. But joyning to this honour our deliverance from thoſe horrid and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate evils, what happineſs may be compared to ours? <hi>Juſtin</hi> writes that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great beholding <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> wounded in the head, and that he loſt much blood, took his Diadem, and bound it about his temples to ſtay his bleeding. This was a great favour from ſo mighty a Prince, as well in the care he took of him, as in the manner, taking the Enſigne of Majeſty from his own head, and giving it to his vaſſal. But <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> had not injuried <hi>Alexander:</hi> he had ſerved him faithfully, and received that wound in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Neither did <hi>Alexander</hi> give him his Diadem for ever, but ſuffer'd him onely to wear it upon that preſent occaſion. But the mortal wound of ſin was not received by man in defence of God, or in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but in rebellion againſt him. Yet God vouchſafes to cure the Traytor, honors him with his own Diadem, which is his Divinitie, communicating it upon him,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:51068:271"/>not for a ſhort ſpace, and then to take it from him, but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtowing it upon him for all eternity. What a bounty is this unto an enemy, that in freeing him from ſuch a miſerie, crowns him with ſo great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                     <p>But if to all this we ſhall add thoſe other bleſſings, which he beſtows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon us, giving us his grace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting us the Sons of God, and making us Heirs of heaven, how infinitly will our obligations increaſe, ſince we are not onely freed from ſo great evils, but enriched with unſpeakable benefits, and our nature ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his favours above that of Angels? All is marvailous, all is great, all is tranſcendent in this unſpeakable goodneſs. The work it ſelf is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the manner and love, by which it was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is tranſcendent. The evils, from which it frees us, are eternal: the rewards, which it prepares for us, are eternal; whoſe greatneſs though it were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be known, might in this ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that to free us from ſo many evils, and crown us with ſo many goods, it was neceſſary that he who was eternal, ſhould make himſelf temporal, and ſhould execute this great and ſtupendious work ſo much to his own loſs.</p>

Yet doth not this great work ſo forcibly demonſtrate unto us the baſeneſs of things temporal, and the contempt which is due unto them, as the Paſſion and Death of the Son of God, which was another work of his love, an other exceſs of his affection, another tenderneſs of our Creator, and a moſt high expreſſion of his good will towards us: wherein we ſhall ſee how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be deſpiſed are all the goods of the Earth, ſince to the end we might contemn them, the Son of God would not onely deprive himſelf of them, but to the contrary embraced all the evils and incommodities this life was capable of. Behold then how the Saviour of the world diſeſteemed temporal things, ſince he calls the beſt of them, and thoſe, which men moſt covet, but thorns; and to the contrary that, which the world moſt hates and abhorrs, he qualifies with the name of bleſſings, favouring ſo much the Poor, who want all things, that he calls them, bleſſed, and ſayes, <hi>Of them is the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> And of the Rich, who enjoy the goods of the earth, he ſayes, <hi>It is harder for them to enter into heaven, then for a Camel to paſs the eye of a needle.</hi> And to perſwade us yet more, he not onely in words but in actions choſe the afflictions, and deſpiſed the proſperity of this life; and to that end would ſuffer in all things as much as could be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. In honour, by being reputed infamous: In riches by being deſpoyled of all even to his proper garments; In his pleaſures, by being a ſpectacle of ſorrow, and afflicted in each particular part of his moſt ſacred body. This we ought to conſider ſeriouſly, that we may imitate him in that contempt of all things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which he principally expreſt in his bitter death and paſſion. This he would have us ſtill to keep in memory, as conducing much to our ſpiritual profit, as an example which he left us, and as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the love he bore us, leaving his life for us,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:51068:272"/>and dying for us a publick death full of ſo many deaths and torments.<note place="margin">Zcnophon in Cyro lib. <hi>3.</hi>

If this Lady were ſo grateful onely for the expreſſion of her husbands affections, that ſhe looked upon nothing but him, and neither admired nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the greatneſs of the Perſians, What ought the Spouſe of Chriſt to do, who not onely ſees the love and affection of the King of Heaven, but his deeds: not his willingneſs to die, but his actual dying a moſt horrid and cruel death for her ranſom and redemption?

Let a Soul conſider what great love and duty it owes to its Spouſe Chriſt Jeſus, who being immortal, did not onely become mortal, but died alſo a moſt ignominious death. Let us conſider whether it be reaſonable it ſhould forget ſuch an exceſſive love, and whether it be fit it ſhould ever be not remembring the ſame, and not thankful for all eternity, hazarding to loſe the fruits of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:51068:272"/>of its Redeemer and Spouſe Chriſt Jeſus. Upon this let thy Soul meditate day and night; and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefits, which ſhe will reap from thence, will be innumerable. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> uſed to ſay,<note place="margin">Lud. de Ponte P. <hi>4.</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc.</note> That the Soul profited more by one holy thought of the Paſſion of Chriſt, than by reciting every day the whole Pſalter, by faſting all the year in bread and water, or chaſtizing the Body even to the effuſion of blood. One day amongſt others when Chriſt appeared unto St. <hi>Gertrude</hi> to confirm her in that devotion ſhe had to his Paſſion, he ſaid unto her: behold Daughter, if in a few hours, which I hung upon the Croſs, I ſo enobled it, that the whole world hath ever ſince had it in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, how ſhall I exalt that Soul in whoſe heart and memory I have continued many years? Certainly it cannot be expreſt, what favour devout Souls obtain from Heaven in thinking often upon God, and thoſe pains, by which he gained tor us eternal bleſſings, and taught us to deſpiſe things temporal and tranſitory.</p>
                  <p>But that we may yet reap more profit by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembrance of our Saviours paſſion, we are to conſider, that Chriſt took upon him all our ſins: and being to ſatisfy the Father for them, would do it by the way of ſuffering; for which it was convenient that there ſhould be a proportion betwixt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his pains and the greatneſs of our ſins. And certainly as our ſins were without bound or limit, ſo the pains of his torments were above all compariſon: ſhewing us by the greatneſs of thoſe injuries, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his paſſion, the greatneſs of thoſe injuries, we did unto God by our inordinate pleaſures. We may alſo gather by the greatneſs of thoſe pains and torments, which were inflicted upon him by the Jews and Hangmen, the greatneſs of thoſe which he inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon himſelf; for certainly thoſe pains, which he took upon himſelf, were not inferior to thoſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from others. But who can explicate the pains, which our Saviour wounded by the grief he conceived
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:51068:273"/>at our offences took upon himſelf? For ſuch is the malice of a mortal ſin, that, if we did but know it as it is, our hearts would burſt with grief, and we could not ſuffer it and live; and therefore many have been known to die ſodainly by the violent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins.<note place="margin">Vincent.

                     </note> St. <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius</hi> writes of a certain light woman, who going to a Sermon deckt and adorned in all bravery, when ſhe heard the Preacher with great zeal and fervour ſet out the hainouſneſs of the ſin of diſhoneſty, ſhe with meer grief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction fell dead in the place; and a voice was heard: ſhe was in heaven.

If then the grievouſneſs of ſin be ſo great, as the grief of it brings death upon them who truely apprehend it, what ſhall we think of the grief of Chriſt, who perfectly knew the hainouſneſs of ſin, and took upon him all the ſins of the world, and grieved for every one of them, as if he himſelf had committed it?

                     </note> Grave Divines affirm that the grief, which Chriſt ſuffered for ſins of men, was more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and intenſe, then all other griefs, what objects ſoever they have, or can have by ordinary power either in Man or Angels; which afflictions he ſuffered all his life: and therefore one of the Pſalms ſayes; <hi>he was in labours from his youth;</hi> which another Lection reades; <hi>He was agonizing and exhaling his ſoul.</hi> It was a cuſtom among the Jewes, that hearing any to blaſpheme or injure God, they tore their garments
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:51068:273"/>in ſigne of grief. What grief did then the Son of God endure for all the blaſphemies, and injuries committed by the whole world againſt his Eternal Father? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he tore not his Garments, but his Body, and powred forth his ſacred blood at a thouſand fountains before he ſubjected it to the power of his Enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the ſins againſt his Father upon his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and tormenting himſelf for our ſins before he was tormented by others. Such was the zeal of the glory of God, which burnt in his breaſt, that he would not pardon himſelf, to the end he might obtain pardon for Man. If the zeal of <hi>Phinees</hi> was ſo great, that behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two perſons commit a ſin he could not contain himſelf from revenging it even with their deaths; If that of <hi>Elias</hi> took away the lives of ſo many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and <hi>Moſes</hi> purpled his hands in the blond of his People, cauſing ſo many thouſands of them to be ſlain: What ſhall be the zeal of Chriſt at the ſight of the ſins of all the world? how vehement his deſire, that God ſhould be revenged? and ſince he would revenge them upon himſelf, what grief and anguiſh did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for the ſins of the whole world? Certainly no words can poſſibly expreſs it. But not contented with thoſe he gave himſelf, he would ſubject himſelf alſo to thoſe which he received from others, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were no ſmall ones, but ſuch as were proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to his burning zeal, and therefore beyond utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance painful and ſevere. Yet thoſe, though rigorous and great, were ſhort of that interiour grief, which he took upon himſelf; for thoſe were inflicted by the rage and madneſs of the Jews, but theſe by his own zeal and charity; and therefore by how much his love was greater than the hatred and malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by ſo much greater was the grief of his heart than that of his ſenſes, and than thoſe pains which he ſuffered in his ſacred body. But it is fit we ſhould alſo often reflect upon the greatneſs of thoſe, which were more particularly ſuffered for our Example, that we

                     <p>Wherefore as Chriſt our Redeemer ſuffered for the ſin of Man, which is totally evil in it ſelf and all the Circumſtances, as we have already diſcourſed: ſo his Paſſion was likewiſe every way moſt grievous and painful, as we ſhall perceive in obſerving thoſe ſeaven Circumſtances noted by <hi>Tully.</hi> Firſt behold, who it is that ſuffers.

All this muſt needs augment his grief, as being a Perſon of ſuch Worth and innocence, as he deſerved it leaſt, and of ſo temperate and perfect a complexion, as he felt it moſt. This Circumſtance of the Perſon, who ſuffered, is recommended to our conſideration by the Apoſtle, when he ſayes;<note place="margin">

Think who it is, who ſuffered upon the Croſs; it is He, who is life eternal.

                        </note> And Sr. <hi>Bernardine</hi> exceeding all this is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedent, that if the grief of the Virgin were divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the creatures that can ſuffer, all would ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly die as uncapable of it: If ſuch then and ſo great were the pains of the Virgin, what ſhall be ſaid of thoſe which Chriſt ſuffered and felt, ſince no ſorrow was as his, no pain could ſtand in competition with his? If then in Torment he ſuffered ſo much, as none but he could ſuffer, in Honour and reputation he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no leſs, and in all manners, that the fury and envy of his Enemies aſſiſted by the Devils could invent. And if he ſuffered ſo much by the compaſſion of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſuffered much more by the compaſſion of our offences.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the grief of his pains was much augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the place, Where he ſuffered, which was the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:51068:275"/>Court of <hi>Judaea,</hi> a place where he had heretofore been much eſteeemed: and of late received in triumph as a man come from Heaven: And certainly to paſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly from one extream to another, from the height of honour to the bottom of contempt and ſcorn, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes much our afflictions; For he became the moſt infamous man in the world, arraigned and condemned to ſuffer between two Theeves, in a publique place deſigned for wicked perſons and murtherers, and in the preſence of his Mother, which doubled the grief of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the perſons, by whom he ſuffered, was a great aggravation unto his grief. It was by them of his own Nation, ſuch as he had favoured with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit benefits: and finding ſome compaſſion in Strangers he found none in his Countrymen; The rage and madneſs, wherewith his enemies deſired his death, being ſuch, as the Scripture compares them to Doggs, wild Beaſts, and Unicorns.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Circumſtance, and that which moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaved his ſorrow, was, To ſee thoſe exceſſive pains and torments misbeſtowed, foreſeeing that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number would not benefit themſelves by them. For as the hope of profit, which is a main end in all our labours, is a great comfort unto us, ſo the deſpair of it as great an affliction. And Chriſt our Redeemer ſuffering, that his merits, bloud, and paſſion might profit all men, when he knew that the hundredth part would not lay hold of it, and that innumerable perſons would prove ungrateful for ſo great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, it was a grief, which beyond all apprehenſion pierced his tender and moſt loving heart.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the Manner of his ſuffering was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. For it was by being generally abandoned of all things, not having any thing whatſoever to comfort him. His own people procured his death with great injuſtice, the Gentils executed it with as great cruelty, and the Prieſts and the learned in the Law were the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:51068:276"/>leaven that ſowred the whole lump. The Princes blew the coals, and kindled ſuch a flame in the People as could not be quenched with thoſe infinite injuries and affronts, which were heaped upon him; nor were they ſatisfied with ſeeing him hang upon the Croſs, whom they had ſo unjuſtly puniſhed, but rent his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bowels with their taunts and ſcoffs. And which was more than all, even in his own Diſciples, which he had bred up in his own School, he found little firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and loyalty. Amongſt his twelve choſen Apoſtles One ſold him, and became the Captain of thoſe, who apprehended him: Another, unto whom he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the principality over the reſt, denied him thrice before his face, curſing himſelf, if he knew him, and the Reſt forſook him in the power of his enemies. O never to be paralelled example of the inconſtancy of humane things, and of the conſtancy which a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to preſerve in all events! What felt that bleſſed heart of our Saviour, when he ſaw himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſo many enemies, and ſo few friends left him?<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.</note> Of him it was truly written; <hi>My heart became as melted wax in the middeſt of my bowels.</hi> True it is, that his bleſſed Mother, when ſhe could neither aſſiſt or defend him, yet forſook him not; but alas her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did not mitigate but encreaſe his ſorrow. The eternal Father, who could onely help him, would not then appear for him, but gave him over to ſuffer with all rigour at the pleaſure of his enemies: which was the more tenderly reſented, as I may ſay, by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, becauſe his enemies caſt it in his teeth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He truſted in God; let him deliver him, if he will have him.</hi> But for all this his Father would not then free him, or afford him any comfort, which our Saviour moſt lovingly complained of, when he ſaid; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Even a cup of water failed him to quench his ſcorching thirſt: ſo as the whole manner of his paſſion, was the moſt grievous and opprobrious, that could be imagned.</p>
                     <pb n="535" facs="tcp:51068:276"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Time of his Paſſion made it much more grievous. It was the Eve of the Paſſover, when the whole Nation was aſſembled, when there was the greateſt concourſe of people to behold him. It was at a time, when he was known to all by the fame of his great works and miracles. It was in the flower of his age; and O what pity was it to behold ſo flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo beautiful, ſo excellently compoſed a body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the grievouſneſs of his torments to ſuch an exigent, that, as the Scripture ſayes, his tongue ſtuck to the pallat of his mouth, ſo fallen in fleſh, that all his bones might be numbred, the whole ſtructure of his body ſo diſcompoſed, that he became as Melted wax, or Spilt water, reſolved into the duſt of death: drie as a piece of an earthen pot, inſomuch as he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Worm and not a Man, the Scorn of the people, and Shame of humane nature. It is alſo worthy our admiration, that in that ſhort proceſs of the Paſſion of Chriſt he ſuffered ſo many griefs and pains, in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds, and with ſuch circumſtances to aggravate them, as no man in the whole ſucceſs of time ſince hath ſuffered any ſort of calamity, or adverſity, which our Redeemer did not then ſuffer in a more bitter manner.</p>
                     <p>In all circumſtances were the pains of Chriſt moſt grievous, becauſe in all circumſtances the offences of men were moſt hainous. It was convenient that he, who came to do us all good, ſhould ſuffer ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: that he, who had no ſin of his own, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the puniſhment due unto the ſins of others: and that he, who was infinitely good, ſhould ſuffer the evil of ſo much grief and torment, to the end we might be inſtructed that thoſe are not evils, which the world fears, but thoſe which ſin brings along with it: and that the goods of the world are ſo far from being real goods, that they are rather to be eſteemed as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſince the Redeemer of the world deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the goods, and burthened himſelf with the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:51068:277"/>evils, to the end that we imitating in our lives his moſt precious death might deſpiſe all temporal goods, which are ſo ſhort and falſe, that even the evils of the world are more true and real goods than they. Let us then be aſhamed, ſeeing Chriſt in ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to ſeek after pleaſures. Let us have at leaſt as great reſpect unto our Redeemer, as <hi>Ethay</hi> the <hi>Gethite</hi> had to <hi>David,</hi> who when the holy King fled from his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and perſwaded him not to follow him in that dangerous condition, made him this anſwer; <hi>The Lord live, and my Lord the King live, in what place ſoever thou ſhalt be either dead or alive, there alſo ſhall thy ſervant be.</hi> If this was ſpoken by a Stranger, what ought to be the loyalty of a natural Subject? Let us bear that faith unto our Saviour, which <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias</hi> did to <hi>Joab</hi> his General, when he ſaid, <hi>The Ark of Gad, and Judah, and Iſrael lodge in Tents, and my Lord Joab, and the Servants of my Lord remain upon the earth, and ſhall I enter into my houſe, and eat, and drink, and ſleep with my Wife? by thy health, and the health of thy Soul, O King, I will do no ſuch thing.</hi> If Chriſt remain upon the Croſs and in ſorrow, how comeſt thou to ſeek for eaſe? If Chriſt be poor, why doeſt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? If Chriſt ſuffer, why doeſt thou pamper thy fleſh? If Chriſt humble himſelf, why doeſt thou ſwell in pride? If Chriſt be in afflictions, why art thou in delights? Remember what he taught thee from the Croſs, and eſteem onely that, which he ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as to deprive himſelf of the tranſitory goods of this life. Conſider the afflictions and penance, which the moſt innocent Jeſus took upon him for thy ſins, that thou mayeſt undergoe ſome for thy ſelf. When the Jews were freed from the captivity of <hi>Babylon, Eſdras</hi> knowing the great ſins they had fallen unto by their converſation with the Gentils, out of a ſenſe and feeling of their tranſgreſſions, rent his garments, and tore the hair off his head and beard, afflicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and abſtained from food, praying unto the Lord,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:51068:277"/>and weeping for the ſins of the people; which reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and penance of his for the ſins of others ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Jews, that they began to weep and do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance themſelves for their own ſins, and that with ſo great compunction, that they trembled for ſorrow, and publickly confeſt their offences. Why are not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then moved with ſorrow and repentance, when they behold not an <hi>Eſdras,</hi> but the Son of God ſo overcharged with grief and ſorrow for the ſins of the world, that he diſtilled drops of blood from the pores of his bleſſed body, and rent his garments, not of wooll, but of his ſacred humanity, which he willingly offered to be torn with ſcourges, thorns, and nails, ſuffered himſelf to be pluckt by the hair of the head and beard, and his ſacred face to be buffetted and ſpit upon, would not taſte, eat, or drink any thing but gall and vinegar, weeping from the Croſs for the ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by us wretches? Let us then weep, afflict our ſelves, and do penance for our own ſins, ſince we ſee our innocent Saviour did it for the ſins of others, that imitating him in ſubmitting our ſelves to thoſe temporal afflictions we may be partakers of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe ſeaven Circumſtances, which ſo much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the pains and torments of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in his paſſion, ought to pierce our very hearts and ſouls with grief and ſorrow. But if they ſhould not prevail with us to deſpiſe the world, and love him onely who ſo infinitely loved us, yet there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances, which with new obligations will not onely move, but force us, if we be not more hard than ſtones, to love and die for him. Whom would not the ſweet manner of his paſſion move, ſeeing the Son of God ſuffer with ſo much love and patience, without complaint of any thing, loving us with that
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:51068:278"/>fervour, that what he did, ſeemed little unto him, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if it had been neceſſary, to ſuffer as much more for us? yea, ſuch was his burning charity towards Mandkind, that if there had been no other way left for our Redemption, he would not have refuſed to continue in thoſe bitter torments till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The affection of Jeſus Chriſt what gratitude doth it not deſerve? And if in benefits the good will, wherewith they are conferred, is moſt to be eſteemed, When the benefit is infinite, and the will of infinite love, what ſhall we do? If, when that Traitor, who murthered <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſentenced to thoſe cruel torments wherein he died, the firſt begotten Son of the dead King, and Heir un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdom had cloathed himſelt in the habit of the Murtherer, and offered to be torn in pieces for him, and to die, that he might be freed from his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not only offered but actually performed it, What love and thanks would the Prince deſerve from that Caitiff? O King of Glory, and onely begotten Son of the eternal Father, in as much as lay in us, we were deſirous to murther thy Father, and to deſtroy his Divine eſſence and being, and therefore were moſt worthy of death and eternal flames. But thou wert not onely willing to die for us, but effectually gaveſt thy blood and life with ſo inhumane torments for us, and wert prepared to ſuffer more and greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for our good. How ſhall we repay ſo great a love? what thanks, what gratitude for ſo immenſe a benefit? Let us alſo conſider, What we our ſelves are, for whom he ſuffered. For he ſuffered not for himſelf, or becauſe it imported him: he ſuffered not for another God, nor for ſome new creature of a ſuperiour nature to all thoſe who now are: not for a Seraphin, who had faithfully ſerved him for an eternity of years, but for a miſerable vile creature, the loweſt of all thoſe, which are capable of reaſon, compoſed of dirt, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. This ſhould make us more grateful, that God
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:51068:278"/>ſuffered ſo much for us, who leaſt deſerved it.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added that he ſuffered thus much for us, not that his ſuffering was neceſſary tor our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and freedom out of the ſlavery of ſin, but took upon him all theſe pains and torments onely to ſhew his love unto us, and to oblige us to imitate him in the contempt of the world and all humane felicity. Let us then behold our ſelves in this Mirrour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our lives. Let us ſuffer with him, who ſuffered ſo much for us. Let us be thankful unto him, who did us ſo much good, and ſo much to his own coſt. Let it grieve our very ſouls that we have offended ſo good a God, who ſuffered ſo many evils, that we ſhould not be evil. Let us admire the Divine goodneſs, who being the honour of Angels, would for ſo vile a creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelf to the reproach of the Croſs. Let us love him, who ſo truly loved us. Let us put our truſt in him, who without asking gave us more than we durſt deſire. Let us imitate this great example propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by the Eternal Father upon Mount <hi>Calvarie.</hi> Let us compoſe our lives conformable unto the death. of his Son our Saviour in all humility and contempt of temporal felicity, that we may thereby attain the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: that humbling our ſelves now, he may exalt us hereafter; that ſuffering here, he may in his good time comfort us; that taſting in this life what is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we may in the other be ſatiated with all ſweetneſs: and that weeping in time we may rejoyce for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; To which end our Saviour ſaid unto the great Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of his Paſſion St. <hi>Francis: Francis,</hi> take thoſe things that are bitter in lieu of thoſe that are ſweet, if thou intendeſt to be happy.

                     <p> The Importance of the Eternal, becauſe God hath made himſelf a means for our obtaining it, and hath left his moſt holy Body as a Pledge of it in the Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANother moſt potent motive to induce us to the eſtimation of what is Eternal, and the contempt of what is Temporal, is, That God hath in the moſt holy and venerable Sacrament of his body and blood made himſelf a means, that we might attain the one by deſpiſing the other; Which holy Myſtery was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, That it might ſerve as a Pledge of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal goods: and therefore the holy Church calls it a Pledge of future glory; and, That it might alſo ſerve us as a Viaticum, whereby we might the better paſs this temporal life without the ſuperfluous uſe of thoſe goods, which are ſo dangerons unto us: Our Lord beſtowing this Divine bread upon us Chriſtians, as he did that of Manna heretofore unto the Hebrews. And therefore as we gave a beginning unto this work with a preſentation of that temporal Manna, which ſerved as a Viaticum unto the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs, ſo we will now finiſh it with the truth of this ſpiritual Manna of the bleſſed Sacrament, which is a Pledge of the eternal goods, and given as
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:51068:279"/>a Viaticum unto Chriſtian people in the peregrination of this life.</p>
                  <p>Let a Chriſtian therefore know how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him to obtain the Eternal, and with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs his Creator deſires it; that having obliged us by thoſe high endearments of his Incarnation, and Paſſion in ſuffering for us ſo grievous and cruel a death, would yet add ſuch an exceſs of love, as to leave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, as a means of our Salvation. Who ſees not here the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, ſince he, who as God omnipotent is the beginning of all things, and as the chief good of all goods, and moſt perfect in himſelf, is likewiſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end, would yet for our ſakes make himſelf a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, which is common to the creatures, and argues no perfection? Our Lord glories in the Scripture that he is the beginning and end of all: And with reaſon; for this is worthy of his greatneſs, and declares a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof only God is capable. But to make himſelf a Medium, and ſuch a Medium, as was to be uſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humane will, and ſubject to the power and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of man, was ſuch a complyance with our nature, and ſuch a deſire of our ſalvation, as cannot be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. the Means of our ſalvation may be conſidered either as they are on Gods part, or on Mans part; for both God and Man work for mans ſalvation. That God ſhould ſerve himſelf for himſelf in the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Paſſion for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſalvation of man, was a high expreſſion of his love: but yet it was God, who was ſerved, and who made uſe of one of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the end which he pretends of his glory; but that man ſhould make uſe of God for his own glorie, is beyond what we can think. What a wonder is it that Chriſt ſhould equal himſelf with Water, Oyle, and Balſome? For as we uſe Water in Baptiſme to juſtify our ſelves, in Confirmation of Balſom to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and fortify our ſelves,, of Oyle in extream Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to purifie our ſelves, ſo in this Sacrament we may
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:51068:280"/>uſe Chriſt for the acquiring of greater grace; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of holineſs. A great matter then is the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, ſince for this purpoſe God, who is his End, was content to be his Means. I know not how the incomprehenſible goodneſs and charitie of God can extend beyond this. Let man therefore reflect how much it imports him to be ſaved; Let him not ſtick at any thing that may further it; Let him leave no ſtone unremoved, let him leave no meanes unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, ſince God himſelf becomes a Means of his ſalvation, and to that end ſubjects himſelf to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and will of a Creature. Let nothing which is temporal divert him, ſince God was not diverted by what was eternal. If therefore to quit thy honours, deny thy pleaſures, diſtribute thy riches unto the Poor be a means to ſave thee, ſtick not at it, ſince God ſtuck not at the greatneſs of his being, which is above all, but gave himſelf for thee.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſed Sacrament was alſo left us as a Pledge of future glory and eternal happineſs. For when Chriſt our Redeemer preached unto the world the contempt of temporal goods for the gaining of the eternal, and pronounced that comfortable ſentence, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> not ſaying Theirs ſhall be, but Theirs is, giving it them in preſent: It was convenient, that ſince they could not then enter into the poſſeſſion of thoſe heavenly joyes, which they had purchaſed with all they had upon earth, that ſome equivalent pledge ſhould now be given them in the time of their forbearance. This pledge is the moſt bleſſed Body of our Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus, Son of the living God, which is of greater worth and value, then the heavens themſelves. Well may we then deſpiſe the fading goods of this life, when we receive in hand ſuch a pledge of the eternal. Well may we renounce the periſhing riches and the pleaſures of nature, when the treaſure of grace is beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:51068:280"/>
                  <p>The bleſſed Sacrament is alſo out Viaticum here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; Whereby we are given to underſtand, that this life is but a pilgrimage, wherein we travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eternity: and that therefore we are not to ſtay and reſt in what is temporal. And becauſe we are neither to enjoy the goods of this temporal life, nor yet to enter upon thoſe of the future, to the end we may better ſuffer the renuntiation of the one, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the hopes of the other, this bleſſed Sacrament is given us as a Viaticum: ſo as the ſoul wandring in this valley of tears (wherein ſhe is not to pleaſe or detain her ſelf in the delights of the world, ſince her journey is for heaven) might have ſomthing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her in this abſence from her Celeſtial Country. Let us then conſider the value of the End whereunto we travel, ſince the journey is defrayd with ſo precious a Viaticum; and that the pleaſures of this world are ſo prejudicial unto our Salvation, that this Pledge is given us from heaven, to the end we ſhould not ſo much as taſte them. The Iſraelites in their peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wilderneſs had Manna for their Viaticum which ſupplyed all their neceſſities for it not onely ſerved to ſuſtain their bodies, but whileſt they fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it they were not ſubject to infirmities, neither did their garments decay with wearing, inſomuch as having it, they had all things. All this is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of our Divine Viaticum: having which, we need nothing, and being provided of ſo Celeſtial a good may well ſpare what is temporal.</p>

                     <p>A moſt principal end alſo of the inſtitution of this moſt admirable Sacrament is to be a memorial of the Paſſion of the Son of God: which being ſo efficacious a motive unto the contempt of things temporal (as we have already ſaid) our Saviour hath almoſt in all the things of nature left us a draught of it.

For this, when loaden with his Croſs the pious <hi>Veronica</hi> preſented him with her Vail, he returned it enriched with the Portraicture of his ſacred countenance: And, as <hi>Lanſpergius</hi> notes, the fingers of the armed Souldier, who gave him the blow, were imprinted in the ſame Vail. For this, when he fell proſtrate in the Garden, and in a ſweat of blood prayed unto his Father, he left ingraved upon the ſtone, whereon he prayed, the print of his feet, knees and hands. And not farr from thence is found another ſtone, where, after he was apprehended, the Souldiers throwing him down upon the ground, he left imprinted the end of his toes, his hands and knees; which ſtone, as <hi>Borcardus</hi> notes, is ſo hard, as 'tis not poſſible to raze or cut any thing out of it even with iron inſtruments: and this to the end the memory of his ineffable meekneſs and partience ſhould be perpetual. In like manner where he paſt the brook of Cedron he left another mark of his ſacred feet, as likewiſe of the rope, wherewith they carried him tied. So firmly would our Saviour have the memory of his Paſſion fixt in our hearts, that he hath left the ſignes of it in the very rocks. There hath been alſo ſeen an Oriental Jaſper accidentally found, whereon the dolorous countenance of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath been exactly formed. And bleſſed <hi>Aloyſius de Gonzaga</hi> walking upon the Sea-ſhore found (with great content of his ſpirit) a pibble, whereon were diſtinctly figured the five wounds of Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And not onely in ſtones, but in ſeveral other peeces of nature,<note place="margin">Anaſt. Sinaita in Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> as St. <hi>Anaſtatius Sinaita</hi> obſerves, he hath left us no obſcure remembrances of his Croſs and Paſſion. In the flower <hi>Granadilla</hi> are perfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Nails, Pillar, and Crown of thorns.

We ſhould never make an end, if we ſhould recount all thoſe ſeveral wayes, by which Chriſt our Saviour hath repreſented unto us his death and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end we ſhould ever have it preſent and fixt in our memorie. But above all, the moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (in which divine myſtery the lively repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his death is as often repeated, as his holy body is conſecrated in the whole world)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a great demonſtration of his infinite love towards mankind: Wherein he gives us to underſtand, that he deſires not onely once, but a million of times to die for us, and that, though he cannot now return again to be crucified by reaſon of the impaſſibility of his glorifyed body, yet his divine charity hath found a way after an unbloody and impaſſible manner to repeat the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Croſs, and the fruit of our redemption. How great a gratitude do we owe our Saviour for ſo infinite an expreſſion of his good will towards us? and how can we be grateful, it forgetful of ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:51068:282"/>and advantageous a benefit? Let not then his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion depart from our thoughts; but let us rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from our pleaſures, and deſpiſe all humane feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſince we behold the Lord of the world in ſuch humility.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this moſt bleſſed Sacrament is not onely a Memorial of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, but of the Incarnation and wonderful works of God: and not onely brings into our memory what Chriſt did, when he ſuffered for us, but what the Eternal Word did, when he became fleſh for us: that immenſe God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the whole Globe of the Earth ſerves but as a footſtool, deſcending from Heaven, and ſo far leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, as to cover that infinite Majeſty under the form of a Servant; of which this Divine Sacrament is a moſt excellent and lively repreſentation. For in it alſo the God of Heaven, being already incarnate and made man, deſcends from Heaven, and vails himſelf under the accidents of a little bread and wine, and there is, as it were, annihilated for us, and become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Beſides, as in the Euchariſt we receive Chriſt crucified, ſo in it alſo we receive the Word incarnate; inſomuch as theſe two great wonders of God, the Paſſion and Incarnation are not onely repreſented, but as it were multiplied unto us in this bleſſed Sacrament: which was a high thought of God, and according to what he ſaid by his Prophet <hi>David,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou haſt made thy wonders many, O Lord: And there is none who is like unto thee in thy cogitations.</hi> Here God made his wonders (that is, his Paſſion and Incarnation,) many, repeating, and, as it were, multiplying them in this bleſſed Sacrament: Which was a moſt high thought of him, who is the ſupreme Wiſdom; nor could it enter into any underſtanding but that of the Divinity, that that which was ſo extraordinary, and ſo far above the reach of all created capacities, as the Son of God to be ſacrificed, and the eternal Word to deſcend from Heaven and be made man, ſhould become ſo ordinary
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:51068:282"/>and familiar, as we daily ſee it in the uſe of this Divine Myſterie. But God did not onely here make his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders many, but made them great, as the ſame <hi>David</hi> cries out; <hi>How magnified are thy works, O Lord!</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.</note> 
                        <hi>Thy cogitations are moſt profound.</hi> For although the works of the Paſſion and Incarnation are ſo great, yet they are as it were enlarged, and made greater by this holy Sacrament. The greatneſs of the work of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſted in this, that God abaſed himſelf, and was made man: and the greatneſs of that of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in that he humbled himſelf unto death. But in this Sacrament he abaſes and humbles himſelf yet low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becoming food for man, which is leſs than to be man, or to die, which is natural unto man. Beſides this, the general fruit of the Incarnation and Paſſion is after a moſt admirable manner particularly applyed in this bleſſed Sacrament to every one, which receives it worthily. The Death and Paſſion of Chriſt upon Mount <hi>Calvarie</hi> was no doubt a great work of God; but in this Myſterie we behold the ſame Death, Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Sacrifice after an unbloody and impaſſible manner, which is certainly the greater miracle, and expreſſes more the Divine power. The Incarnation likewiſe, when the Eternal Word entred into the womb of a Virgin, was a great work of God; but in this Myſterie it is in a certain manner extended and made greater; and is therefore called an extenſion of the Incarnation, our Lord here entring into the breaſt of every Chriſtian, and uniting himſelf unto him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the marvails of the Law of Grace; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Prophet <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaid unto the Lord:<note place="margin">

And as onely God can truly value it, ſo it is not in the power of man ſufficiently to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it: No humane heart being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weight of ſuch an obligation, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine love, which ſhines forth in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of wonders.<note place="margin">Tertul. li. de Patien. cap. <hi>1.</hi>

                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, The greatneſs of ſome goods were intolerable; the which according to the Prophet <hi>Iſaias</hi> is verified in this Divine good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which we were not able to ſupport. Wherefore it is called in holy Scripture, <hi>The good, or the good thing of God:</hi> becauſe it is a good and a benefit, which more clearly than the Sun diſcovers the infinite and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſs of God, to the aſtoniſhment and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a humane heart; and therefore the Prophet <hi>Oſeas</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>They ſhall be aſtoniſhed at the Lord, and at his Good;</hi> becauſe his Divine benefit amazes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhes the Soul of man to ſee how good the Lord is, and how great the good which he communicates unto us; All which tends to no other end than to make us deſpiſe the goods of the Earth, and to eſteem onely thoſe of Heaven, which we attain unto by this Divine myſterie. For this therefore did Chriſt our Redeemer inſtitute this moſt bleſſed Sacrament, that by it we might withdraw our hearts from things temporal, and ſettle our affections upon thoſe which are eternal, for which it is moſt particularly efficacious, as thoſe who worthily receive it have full experience.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore let that Soul, who goes to communicate, conſider, Who it is that enters into him, and Who he is himſelf, who entertains ſo great a Gueſt. Let him call to mind with what reverence the bleſſed Virgin received the Eternal Word, when he entred into her holy Womb; and let him know it is the ſame Word, which a Chriſtian receives into his entrails in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrament: Let him therefore endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach this holy Table with all reverence, love, and gratitude, which ought, if poſſible, to be greater than that of the bleſſed Mother. For then the obligation of Mankind was not ſo great, as now it is. For neither ſhe, nor we were then indebted unto him for his dying upon the Croſs. Let him conſider that he receives the ſame Chriſt, who ſits at the right hand of God the Father, That it is he, who is the ſupreme Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, He, whom the Angels adore, He, who created and redeemed us, and is to judge the living and the dead, He, who is of infinite wiſdom, power, beauty, and goodneſs. If a Soul ſhould behold him, as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> beheld him, and was ſtruck blind with his light and ſplendour, how would he fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him? Let him know that he is not now leſs glorious in the Hoſt, and that he is to approach him with as much reverence, as if he ſaw him in his Throne of glory. With much reaſon did St. <hi>Tereſa</hi> of Jeſus ſay unto a devout Soul, unto whom ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after death, That we upon earth ought to behave our ſelves unto the bleſſed Sacrament, as the bleſſed in Heaven do towards the Divine Eſſence, loving and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring it with all our power and forces. Conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that he, who comes in perſon to thee, is that ſelf ſame Lord, that required ſo much reverence, that he ſtruck <hi>Oza</hi> dead, becauſe he did but touch with his hand the Ark of his Teſtament, and ſlew 50000 <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamits</hi>
                        <pb n="550" facs="tcp:51068:284"/>for their looking on it; And thou not onely ſeeſt, and toucheſt, but receiveſt him into thy very bowells. See then with what reverence thou oughteſt to approach him. The Angels and Seraphins tremble before his greatneſs, and the Juſt are afraid. Do thou then tremble, fear and adore him. S. <hi>John</hi> ſtanding but near unto an Angel remained without force, aſtoniſht at the greatneſs of his Beauty and Majeſty; and thou art not to receive an Angel, but the Lord of Angels into thy entrails. It adds much to the endearment of this great benefit of our Saviour, that it is not onely great by the greatneſs of that, which is beſtowed, but by the meaneneſs of him, who receives it. For what art thou but a moſt vile creature, compoſed of clay and dirt, full of miſery, ignorance, weakneſs, and malice? If the Centurion held himſelf unworthy to receive Chriſt under his roof, and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when our Saviour was in this mortal life, deemed himſelf not worthy to be in his preſence, ſaying, <hi>Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a ſinful man:</hi> and St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> thought himſelf not worthy to unlooſe the latchet of his ſhoe, How much more oughteſt thou to judge thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to receive him into thy bowels, being now in his glory ſeated at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The Angels in heaven are not pure in his ſight: What purity ſhouldeſt thou have to entertain him in thy breaſt? If a mighty King ſhould viſit a poor Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in his Cottage, what honour, what reſpects would it conferre upon him? Behold God, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, comes to viſit thee, not in thy houſe, but within thy ſelf. Seaven years did <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpend in building a Temple, wherein to place the Ark of the Teſtament. Why doeſt thou not ſpend ſome time in making thy ſelf a Temple of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? <hi>Noah</hi> was a hundred years in preparing a Veſſel, wherein to ſave thoſe, who were to eſcape the Deluge. Why doeſt thou not ſpare ſome dayes or hours to make thy ſelf a Sacriſty for the Saviour of the World? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:51068:284"/>thy own unworthineſs, and what thou goeſt a-about. <hi>Moyſes,</hi> when he was to make an Ark for the Tables of the Law, not onely made choice of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wood, but covered it all with gold. Thou miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and vile Worm, why doeſt thou not prepare and adorn thy ſelf to receive the Lord of the Law?</p>
                     <p>Conſider alſo what is the end, for which thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour comes unto thee. It is by communicating his grace to make thee partaker of his Divinity. He comes to cure thy ſores and infirmities; he comes to give remedy to thy neceſſities; he comes to unite himſelf unto thee; he comes to Deifie thee. Behold then the infinity of his Divine goodneſs, who thus melts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in communication with his Creatures. Behold what is here given thee, and for what it is given thee. God gives himſelf unto thee, that thou mayeſt be all divine, and nothing left in thee of earth. In other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits God beſtows his particular gifts upon thee; but here he gives thee himſelf, that thou mighteſt alſo give thy ſelf unto him, and be wholly his. If from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God we gather the great love he bore unto mankind, paſſing for his ſake from that height of greatneſs unto that depth of humiliation, as to incloſe himſelf in the Womb of a Virgin: Behold how in this he loves thee, ſince to ſuſtain thee in the life of grace he hath made himſelf the true food of thy Soul, and comes from the right hand of the eternal Father to encloſe himſelf in thy moſt impure breaſt. Jeſus Chriſt comes alſo to make thee one body with himſelf, that thou mayeſt after an admirable manner be united unto him, and made partaker not onely of his ſpirit, but of his bloud. That, which this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ought to work in the breaſt of a Chriſtian, may appear by what a leſs than this wrought in the heart of a Heathen. The Emperour and Philoſopher <hi>Antoninus</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Anton. l. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> That in reſpect we are a part of the world, we ought to reſt content and ſatisfied with what accidents ſoever ſhall befall us, and to doe
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:51068:285"/>nothing unworthy of reaſon. What ought we then to do for being a part of Chriſt? Our works certainly ought not to be onely worthy of Angels, but of the ſons of God.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the manner, by which this Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is conferred, a little endear it unto thee. It is with ſuch ſingular love, as is in uniting himſelf unto thee: It is in feeding thee with his precious body and bloud: It is by humbling himſelf as much as he could for thee: It is by treading under foot the moſt conſtant Lawes of Nature, and working more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prodigious miracles for thee, than <hi>Moyſes</hi> did in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> All which is a demonſtration of that infinite deſire, wherewith he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thy good, ſticking at nothing that may advance it. God gives himſelf unto thee after the moſt eaſie and facile manner for man, and after the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary for God. He gives himſelf unto thee for meat. Nothing is more natural for man than to eat, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſupernatural, than that God ſhould ſerve as meat. Let him then, who comes from receiving this heavenly food, conſider what he owes for ſo unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable a benefit. Let him make account, that Chriſt ſeated in his heart, ſpeaks unto him after the manner he ſpake unto his Apoſtles, when he had waſhed their feet. Thou knoweſt, O ſoul, what I have done unto thee; Thou knoweſt the gift I have beſtowed upon thee; Thou knoweſt the honour and ſavour I have conferred upon thee; Thou knoweſt what thou haſt received; Thou knoweſt what thou haſt within thee. Know it is thy God and Redeemer; know it is he who deſires all good unto thee. Be therefore thankful unto him; deſire nothing of earth, but fix wholly upon what is eternal and thy chief good.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p> Whether temporal things and to be demanded of God; And that we onely ought in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to aim at goods eternal.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe difference betwixt Temporal and Eternal is eaſily diſcovered by the ſmall account which God makes of granting things temporal, and the great pleaſure he takes in our demanding things eternal. The temporal is ſometimes granted as a chaſtiſement, The eternal as a great reward: and were it not for the infinite merits of his Son would not be granted at all. For this reaſon Chriſt himſelf commands us, that we ſhould ask the Father in his name, aſſuring us that whatſoever is ſo demanded, ſhall be granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when he invites his Diſciples to ask, he tells them, That hitherto they had demanded nothing: eſteeming that though indeed they had asked, him ſomethings temporal, yet becauſe they had not as yet demanded any thing that was eternal, they had asked nothing. So as the promiſe of our Saviour, That his Father would grant all our petitions in his name, is to be underſtood onely, When we petition for the eternal goods of grace and glory. The temporal is of ſo little worth, that for it ſelf, or in his name Chriſt would not have us ask it. Neither does he promiſe that it ſhould be granted; For in the Divine acceptance, all, which doth not conduce and help to our ſalvation, is reputed as nothing. Whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſayes;<note place="margin">Auguſ. Trac. in Johan.</note> 
                     <q>This joy is demanded in the name of Chriſt, if we underſtand divine grace, if we demand that life which is true happineſs. If any thing elſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nothing is demanded; not that in reality in it ſelf it is nothing, but that in compariſon of ſo
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:51068:286"/>great things, whatſoever beſides is deſired, is to be eſteemed as nothing;</q> in ſo much as, according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> though you demand temporal things a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over, yet you demand nothing.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon many wiſe men have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may lawfully petition God for the temporal things of the world. I will firſt deliver the opinions of the greateſt Philoſophers, and then how the graveſt Divines have decided this controverſie. <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in the name of many Philoſophers ſayes, That we are not at all to demand what is temporal, but that we are rather to pray, that we may not eſteem or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them; and therefore in a moſt prudent diſcourſe, wherein he wants nothing of a Chriſtian, but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of one ſole God inſtead of many, he thus argues.<note place="margin">Marc. Antonin. lib. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>Either the Gods can do ſomething or not. If not, Why doeſt thou pray unto them? If they can, Why doeſt thou not rather pray them to grant that thou mayeſt neither fear nor deſire the things of the earth, not to be afflicted more with their want, than their poſſeſſion? For if the Gods be able to aſſiſt men at all, they are able to aſſiſt them in this. Perhaps thou wilt ſay, The Gods have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected theſe things unto thy own power. Be it ſo. Yet tell me: Is it not better thou ſhouldeſt uſe theſe things, which are in thy power, with freedom, than with a ſervile and abject minde to be ſollicitous and afflict thy ſelf for thoſe things, which are not in thy power? And who hath told thee, that the Gods do not help us in thoſe things, which are ſubject unto us? Begin then to pray tor thoſe things, and thou ſhalt ſee what will happen. This man prayes he may enjoy ſuch a woman: Doe thou pray thou mayeſt have no ſuch deſire. Another prayes he may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſomething which troubles him: Doe thou pray thou mayeſt have no need to be eaſed. Another prayes he may not loſe his Son: Doe thou pray thou mayeſt not fear it. Make thy prayers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:51068:286"/>this manner, and ſee what will follow.</q> In ſo much then as it was the opinion of this Philoſopher, that we ſhould not pray unto God for things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but for the right way of uſing them, which is true vertue: Let us alſo hear what was ſaid by <hi>Socrates</hi> the moſt excellent of Moral Philoſophers, who judged (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> relates him) that nothing in particular was to be demanded of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S. Tho.</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>art.</hi> 5.</note> but onely that he would give us good things, becauſe God onely knows what is good and expedient for us: and men for the moſt part deſire and pray for thoſe things, which (if obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are hurtful. This opinion is approved by St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and the reſt of the Divines in as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns temporal things, which we may uſe ill. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Angelical Doctor concludes, that we are not determinately to pray for any thing temporal, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſpiritual and eternal. Theſe are onely thoſe, which ought and may be abſolutely prayed for; other things, as they ſerve to obtain theſe, in a ſecondary way, and as much of them onely, as is ſufficient, and expedient for to obtain the eternal.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that thoſe prayers, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God onely for the obtaining of things eternal without reſpect to any temporal or earthly commodity, are as a ſweet ſavour unto the Lord, like that Rod of perfume ſo much celebrated in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.</note> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of incenſe, myrrhe, and ſpices, which aſcended ſtreight unto heaven. Whereupon St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes, that prayer is called that little Rod of ſweet ſmoke: becauſe, whileſt it onely ſupplicates for eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, it mounts directly to heaven without inclining unto any thing that is earthly. Well may it be ſeen how little our Saviour is pleaſed with earthly petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by that anſwer he gave unto the Wife of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> when ſhe deſired that her two Sons might have the honour to ſit one at the right hand of his Throne, and the other at the left; Our Saviour anſwered, They know not what they asked; becauſe, as St. <hi>Chyſoſtome</hi>
                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:51068:287"/>ſayes, Their petition was for the things temporal, and not ſpiritual and eternal. Certainly a fool he is, who when he may have heaven for asking, trifles away his time in demanding things of the earth. A fool he is, who when he needs but to demand eternal glory, buſies himſelf in praying for temporal honours. A fool he is, who having but to ask grace from God, loſes his time in asking favours from men. Certainly he knows not what he prayes for, who prayes to be rich. He knows not what he prayes for, who prayes for great Places and Commands. Finally, who prayes for honours, accommodations, pleaſures, or any thing that ends in time, knows not what he prayes for, becauſe he knows not how little is all that which time conſumes.</p>

                        <hi>Paludanus</hi> obſerves three errors in the Petition of the mother of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>John.</hi> The firſt,<note place="margin">Palud.

All theſe errors are ſound, when not attending unto the eternal we peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for what is temporal. For of the firſt, who ſees not that he who demands temporal things, violates and perverts all order? for what more diſorderly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to demand little, when we may obtain much, to ſue for that, whereof we have no need, and to neglect that, which is extreamly neceſſary? The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the body hold no compariſon with thoſe of the ſoul. The ſoul hath more neceſſity of divine grace, than the body of food. The ſoul hath more enemies: and ſtands therefore in more need of the favour and aſſiſtance of heaven.<note place="margin">Gelaſ. contra Pelag. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſ. <hi>5.</hi> lib. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> It is againſt her, that the infernal powers have conſpired; and therefore it is ſhe who ſtands in moſt neceſſity of divine ſuccour. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Pope ſpeaking of our firſt Parents, ſaith, That when
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:51068:287"/>they were in the ſtate of innocency, repleniſhed with all thoſe gifts of graces, wherewith God had enriched them, and that they had not thoſe adverſaries which now we have, (for neither the world nor the fleſh were then their enemies,) Yet becauſe they did not pray for the divine aſſiſtance and favour, that they fell into ſin. Having received, ſaith this great Pope, ſuch abundance of grace, yet becauſe they did not pray, (as their is no mention that they did) they were not ſecure. How needfull is it then for us to pray, who want that original juſtice, have our nature weakned and corrupted by ſin, our fleſh rebellious againſt the ſoul, the World with all its inſtruments of vanity and deceit, and ſo many occaſions and dangers of ſinning, our enemies and the devil himſelf irritated by thoſe ſingular favours expreſt towards our nature by the Son of God, more fierce againſt us then before? So as it is not poſſible to declare the great need we have of divine grace. And now to forget this great neceſſity, and to forbear crying unto heaven for a remedy, from whence we can onely hope it, how great a folly and diſorder is it? If a man in the Dog-dayes were expoſed naked in ſome Deſert againſt the ſcorching beams of the Sun, and ready to periſh for thirſt, and ſhould meet one, who were furniſhed with plenty of cool water, would he not ask ſome to refreſh him? or if he forbore to ask it, would he demand a warm Jacket, which were onely uſeful in Winter, and in Summer a burthen and a trouble? Certainly a greater madneſs and diſorder cannot be imagined; And yet ours is far worſe, if we demand temporal goods, which can onely hinder and entangle us, and neglect to pray for the water of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, without which we are certain to periſh. But even in temporal things themſelves we know not what order to obſerve in our demands: becauſe we are ignorant which are moſt convenient for us. Who knows whether it be better for him to be ſick or in health: ſince it may ſo happen, that being in health he
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:51068:288"/>may fall into ſome grievous ſin and be damned, and being ſick he may repent and be ſaved? Who knows whether poverty or wealth may be more convenient for him: ſince being in abundance he may forget God, and being in neceſſity of all things he may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto his holy ſervice? Who knows whether it be better for him to be honoured, or ſuffer confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſince honour may puff him up in vanity, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation may make him prudent and wary? No man knows what is good or evil for him. That which we deſire is oftentimes our ruin and deſtruction, and thoſe evils which we weep for, as often turn into our greateſt happineſs. How can there then be any order in our prayers for temporal things, whereof we are totally ignorant whether they are good or hurtful.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond great errour in our prayers for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things is the diſordinate affection, and want of pure intention, which accompanies ſuch petitions: whereas our prayers ought onely to proceed from a pure and mortified mind, wholly intent upon the ſervice of God. To ſignify this, The fire, which was to burn the incenſe, was fetcht from the Altar of <hi>Holocauſts;</hi> and that our prayers may be acceptable and of a ſweet ſavour unto God, they are to ſpring from an enflamed heart, Sacrificed unto his divine Majeſty in a true <hi>Holocauſt</hi> of our whole will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; And he who demands any temporal things from God Almighty after another manner, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear leaſt they may be granted for his greater pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Therefore St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>St. Tho.</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>art.</hi> 19.</note> that our Lord God grants unto ſinners what they deſire with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil affection for a Chaſtizement of their deſires. So he granted Quails unto the murmuring Iſrealites, who died with the morſel in their mouths. We ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be cautious in our prayers, and tremble at our own deſires, ſince their ſucceſs may prove ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto us. And I wonder not at all that he, who deſires the goods of this world, is often puniſhed in
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:51068:288"/>the grant of his petition, ſince it is a kind of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to uſe God as a Medium for the obtaining of that, which does or may ſeparate us from him, who is our chief and utmoſt end. <hi>Guigo Cathuſianus</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Guigo Carthuſ. in Medit.</note> that he, who prayes for temporal things, uſes God Almighty, as the Spouſe does her Husband, when ſhe deſires him to bring her with his own hands ſome vile ſlave, with whom ſhe may adulterate. So we deſiring temporal goods encreaſe our affection to the things of the earth, which make us forget the love of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and praying for them, pray for the inſtruments and occaſions of offending him. Let us not commit this treaſon againſt our Lord God, but let us ask what may redound to his glory and our own profit, which is only that, which is ſpiritual and eternal, to wit his grace, his knowledge, the imitation of his Son, the contempt of the world, and what is conformable to his holy will. This we may ſafely ask, and this he will certainly give us, becauſe it is for our true good. And therefore in the prayer, which our Lord himſelf hath taught us, when we have ſaid, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> we proceed in a bolder manner, and ſay in an impara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> having then a kinde of certainty of obtaining, when we have firſt conformed our prayers to the divine will; and it is then, as <hi>Origen</hi> notes, a ſingular confidence we have in God to command what we pray for.</p>
                     <p>The third error in our petitions for temporal goods is, that we pray for things vain without ſubſtance or profit; for ſuch is all temporal greatneſs and felicity, ſhort, vain, inconſtant, tranſitory and unworthy the heart of man, which ought wholly to fix upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and trample the reſt under foot, like that myſterious woman in the Apocalyps, who was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and penetrated by the Sun, which filled the heart and bowels, but trod the Moon under her feet: the Sun which is perfectly circular, being a Symbol of
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:51068:289"/>eternity, and the Moon, which is defective and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, a figure of the temporal. The Sun hath its own proper light: the Moon none but what ſhe borrows from the Sun. In the ſame manner the eternal is a good in it ſelf, and deſirable for it ſelf; the temporal hath no good at all, but what it acquires by being a means of obtaining the eternal. All humane felicity is but vanity, ſmoke, thorns, deceit, and miſery. With what face can a Chriſtian demand ſuch ſtuff from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? and ſuch is all humane proſperity in Gods acceptance.<note place="margin">Chryſoſ. hom. <hi>79.</hi> in Mat.</note> Out of which conſideration St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks in this manner; <q>A Roman Judge will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thy allegations, unleſs thou ſpeak unto him in the Roman tongue. In the like manner Chriſt will not hear thee, unleſs thou ſpeak unto him in his own language, and thy mouth be conformable unto his.</q> In the language of our Redeemer, riches are thorns, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſmoke, and pleaſures vipers; and therefore he who prays for things of this nature, prayes but for ſo many evils. And as there is no Father, that, if his Son inſtead of bread demand a Scorpion, will give it him; ſo God to thoſe, whom he loves and holds as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they ask him temporal goods, denies them: becauſe he ſees they are not good for them. For this reaſon the honour demanded by the Wife of <hi>Zebedaeus</hi> for her two ſons was denyed by our Saviour with this anſwer, That they knew not what they asked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that for a good, which was not, and in room of the honour, which they deſired in a temporal Kingdom, he gave them Martyrdom, which they thought not of, which conduced to real and eternal happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Let us learn therefore How and for What to pray, that we erre not in a matter of ſuch importance: For if the error be ſo much greater, by now much the matter, in which it falls, is of greater moment, an error in matter of prayer muſt be moſt great, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally having a divine precept, and an infallible promiſs,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:51068:289"/>that if we demand what is neceſſary for our Salvation in his name we ſhall not fail of obtaining it. Let us not therefore ask that in the name of our Saviour, for which he would not die, but that which he bought for us with his precious blood and life, which is the bleſſings of heaven, and our eternal felicity. For this let us ſigh, for this let us pray, and let us reflect how great and faulty a careleſneſs it is not to pray ever for that, which imports us ſo much as heaven, and for which only we have a certain promiſe to be heard, and not for other things, which the world eſteems, and time conſumes.</p>

                  <p>IF all which hath been ſaid ſuffice not to make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the goods of the earth for the gaining of thoſe bleſſings we hope for in heaven: and if neither the example nor remonſtrances of our Saviour will ſerve to make us eſteem the Eternal, and contemn the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but that we will for all this preferre the one, though little and baſe, becauſe preſent, before the other, though great and immenſe, becauſe to come: Yet let our preſent intereſt, and the word and promiſe of the Son of God move us, which certainly, if ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly weighed, will not onely perſwade us to deſpiſe, but totally to renounce the goods of the world, as many of the Philoſophers have done, that they might more freely enjoy the pleaſures and commodities of this life, and many Saints for the hopes they have had of the other. Let us here call to mind what was ſaid by the Saviour of the world,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall leave fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or mother, or brothers, or ſiſters, or houſe, or land for
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:51068:290"/>my ſake, ſhall in this life receive a hundred-fold and after death life eternal.</hi> In which words we are to conſider the greatneſs of the promiſe, and the importance of that, for which ſo great things are promiſed. Without doubt it muſt be of high concernment to renounce our temporal goods, ſince the Son of God invites us to it with ſo great promiſes, and if it be convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them as things poyſonous and hurtful to us, we can have no excuſe for not deſpiſing them; or at leaſt, if we do not deſpiſe them, yet we can have no reaſon to love and prefer them before the eternal. Much and extremely much it will concern us to deſpiſe that, which is convenient for us to leave, and as much to pluck from our hearts the affection of thoſe things, which are not fit for us to poſſeſs. Neither is it much to ſay, that it is advantagious for us to renounce theſe temporal things, ſince St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> judged it neceſſary; and therefore, according to the Apoſtle, ſayes, That the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is avarice, from which, and from pride, which accompanies it, all ſins have their birth, food and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it the foundation of the City of <hi>Babylon.</hi> This Covetouſneſs is ſeated in the affections of the ſoul as in its proper ſubject, but is fed and receives nouriſhment from thoſe exteriour things, which we poſſeſs. Wherefore wholly to extripate it two things are neceſſary, not onely to quit this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour thirſt and gaping after riches, but alſo that exteriour poſſeſſion of them. The firſt is to be done by the will and ſpirit: but the ſecond by an actual and effectual execution and forſaking them; and it is for this that we are promiſed in this life a hundred-fold, and in the next eternal felicity. O how great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is there diſcovered betwixt things temporal and eternal, ſince the onely hope of the eternal beſtows more upon us even in this life, then we can receive from the dominion and poſſeſſion of all that is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral! Temporal goods by being enjoyed and poſſeſt are not ſo much as doubled, but by being renounced
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:51068:290"/>for Chriſt are multiplyed a hundred-fold, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conferr the Kingdom of Heaven. Abundance of temporal goods (as hath been already obſerved) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obſtruct the pleaſures and contents of this life, for which we ſeek them, and hereafter throw their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors into hell flames; ſo as they are not onely the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of eternal pain, but by anticipation of many temporal inconveniences. For, I know not how it coms to paſs, the moſt rich are not the moſt contented, nor yet the leaſt neceſſitated. It ſeems their goods diminiſh in their hands, and are of leſs value amongſt them, than the poor: at leaſt ten is not worth to a rich man, ſo much as one to a poor; ſo as the poor, who have renounced their goods for Chriſt, finde them multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hundred-fold, and the rich, who forgetting their Redeemer employ themſelves wholly in heaping up wealth, find them as much diminiſhed, and of a hundred enjoy not one. Beſides, the rich are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with cares, dangers, fears, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they know not the true contents of this life, and yet run the hazard of eternal damnation in the other. But to the contrary thoſe, who are poor in ſpirit, and have forſaken their poſſeſſions for Chriſt, are in this world filled with joy, peace and comfort, and in the next enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven. O how happy are they who underſtand this, and know how to change earth for heaven! O how truly doth Chriſt call happy the poor in ſpirit, who have left all for his ſake, and therefore enjoy a double happineſs, the one preſent, and the other future: here a hundred-fold for that which they poſſeſs not, and hereafter the poſſeſſion of life eternal! O how happy is he, who knows with the riches of the earth to purchaſe the treaſure of glory in death, and in life to receive them a hundred-fold doubled!</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Caſſian. Collat. ult. c. ult.</note>This according to Abbot <hi>Abraham</hi> is fully verified in religious perſons, who have quitted all they have upon earth to live in an eſtate of poverty: who for one
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:51068:291"/>Father, which they have left, find a hundred in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for one Brother a hundred who embrace them with Chriſtian charity, for one poſſeſſion a hundred poſſeſſions, and for one houſe a hundred houſes in the multitude of Monaſteries founded for their Order; ſo as there is no doubt, but this reward is not onely doubled unto them a hundred-fold, but multiplied to a farre greater proportion. The ſame may be ſeen in other ſervants of God, who ſerve him in voluntary poverty,<note place="margin">Beda de Nat. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</note> who by how much (as <hi>Bede</hi> notes) they have ſerved God with more affection in renouncing their temporal goods, by ſo much hath God ſtirred up the affections and liberalities of others to ſupply and aſſiſt them in all their wants. So as they are ſerved with the goods of all, and, as the Apoſtle ſayes, having nothing poſſeſs all.</p>
                  <p>But although this recompence ſhould fail us, yet one a hundred-fold greater then this will not fail us, which is that noted by St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> in Math.</note> 
                     <hi>He who for our Saviours ſake leaves carnal things, ſhall receive ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which in compariſon and value are, as if ſome ſmall number were compared with a hundred.</hi> We ſeek the goods of the earth for the eaſe and content of life. But if this may better and with more advantage be acquired by the contempt and leaving them, what can we deſire more? Certainly he who quits all for Chriſt, enjoyes a hundred times more content and pleaſure then he who flows in the greateſt riches and abundance; for (according to what hath been ſaid) the goods of this life are tedious and troubleſome even to life it ſelf: ſo the freedom from thoſe cares and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which accompany them, eaſes the heart, and makes our life more ſweet and pleaſant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> notes, That as the Children in the middeſt of the fiery furnace in <hi>Babylon</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſht by a cool wind and pleaſant dew, to thoſe, who are in poverty (which the holy Scripture calls a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace) are recreated by a gentle aire from heaven, and
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:51068:291"/>the dew of the holy Spirit: and that in ſo high a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking of the Monks of <hi>Claraval,</hi> ſayes, That they drew from their Poverty, Faſts, and auſtere Penances ſuch joy and ſpiritual comfort, that they were jealous, and afraid, leaſt God had given them their whole and compleat reward in this world: and it ſeemed unto them, that having their heaven in this life, they ſhould loſe it in that to come. Whereupon it was neceſſary for St. <hi>Bernard</hi> to prove unto them in one of his Sermons, That he did injure the grace of the holy Spirit, who placed grief in what it communicated. Certainly the Servants of God are highly rewarded, ſince they receive even in this life ſuch celeſtial joyes for thoſe temporal trifles, which they have quitted. If one for a certain weight of Copper were to receive the like in Gold,<note place="margin">Caſſian. Sup.</note> I believe he would think he had made a good bargain. The like exchange they make, who receive thoſe ſpiritual joyes for the pleaſures of the earth.<note place="margin">In Hiſtor. Ciſtere.</note> This is fully verified in that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto <hi>Arnulphus</hi> the Ciſtercian, who being rich, noble, and abounding with all, which the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems, moved by the Sermons of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> became a Monk in the Monaſtery of <hi>Claraval,</hi> where after a holy life led in much rigour and auſterity, he at laſt became very infirm, and through the great grief and pains, which he ſuffered, would often fall into faintings and ſounding trances: but ſtill, when he recovered from his fits, would cry out, It is true, it is true, which thou haſt ſaid, O bleſſed Jeſus. And to ſome preſent, who thought the extremity of pain did make him rave, he would ſay, Brethren, I have ſpoken this in my right judgement and ſenſes; for that which our Lord promiſed in the Goſpel, That he, who for his ſake ſhould leave Father, Mother, or Goods, ſhould receive a hundred fold, and hereafter life eternal, I now find true by experience: For this grief and pain, which I feel, is ſo ſweet unto me out of the hope I have of eternal happineſs, that I would not loſe theſe
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:51068:292"/>pains and this hope not onely for what I have left al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but for a hundred times more. And if to me, who am ſo great a ſinner, thoſe pains, which I deſerve, are a hundred times more ſweet than any former power and pleaſures in the world, What are they to a juſt man, and to the zealous and devout religious? By this it evidently appears, that ſpiritual joy, though but in hope, affords a thouſand times more pleaſure and content, than the poſſeſſion of all the carnal and temporal delights in the world. At what this Servant of God ſaid, all who were preſent remained aſtoniſht, that an ignorant man wholly unlettered ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and ſpeak of ſo high matters.</p>

                     <p>The joy of the poor in Chriſt Jeſus, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all for his love, ſprings from two cauſes; Firſt from that content, which Poverty it ſelf by its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from temporal troubles and the imbroilments of life brings along with it. And this even the Gentils confeſſed. And therefore <hi>Apuleius</hi> called it Merry and and chearful Poverty. And <hi>Seneca</hi> would ſay, That a Turf of earth gave a ſounder ſleep, than Wooll dyed in <hi>Tyrian</hi> Purple. And <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> (taught by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) That he found more content in ſleeping upon the Earth, and feeding upon Hearbs, than in Down Beds and delicious Banquets accompanied with an unquiet mind. The ſecond cauſe of this joy is not the nature of poverty, but the particular grace of God, who rewards them with the pleaſures of heaven, who have renounced thoſe of earth, and fills with ſpiritual riches thoſe, who have left the temporal. For in truth poverty is much beloved and priviledged by Chriſt: and therefore he rewards the poor even in this life with many particular graces and favours.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, the many and great commodities, which this contempt of earthly things brings along
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:51068:292"/>with it, may ſerve as a reward equivalent to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, yea a thouſand-fold. For if all the world were given to eſcape the committing of one ſin, it were not an equal value; and by Evangelical poverty and contempt of the world the ſins, which we avoid, are innumerable. For by it we not onely pluck up the root, but quit the inſtruments of ſinning. Take away abundance, and you take away inſolence, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and pride, which ſpring from it, as ſmoke from fire; you take away alſo the means of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many other ſins, which riches feed and nouriſh. Neither is the attaining of many vertues, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Poverty, as Humility, Modeſty, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, of leſs value than the avoidance of thoſe ſins. And therefore it is a great truth,<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>8.</hi> in Ep. ad Hebr.</note> which Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> notes and ponders, That in Poverty we poſſeſs Vertues more eaſily. Neither is it ſleightly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, That the ſtate of Poverty aſſiſts much toward our ſatisfaction for thoſe ſins we have committed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what is ſpoken to the juſt man by <hi>Iſaias</hi> the Prophet; <hi>I have choſen thee</hi> (that is I have purified thee) <hi>in the furnace of poverty.</hi> It is likewiſe a great matter to be free and uninterreſſed in the baſe and unprofitable employments of the earth, whereby the poor have time to exerciſe vertue, to converſe with God and his Angels, and contemplate Eternity.</p>
                     <p>The honour alſo and dignity to command theſe things below, which is attained by the poor in ſpirit, may well be valued at a hundred-fold. For as it is a great baſeneſs in the rich to be ſlaves to their avarice, and to things ſo vile as riches: So it is a great honour to the poor to exempt themſelves from this ſlavery and ſervitude, and to lord it over all; and, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes, by contemning all to poſſeſs all; ſo as there is no Riches, no Kingdom comparable to this of Poverty. Kingdoms have their limits and bounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they paſs not; but this Kingdom of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is not ſtraightned by any bounds: but for the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:51068:293"/>ſame reaſon, that it hath nothing, hath all things; for the heart cannot be ſaid to poſſeſs any thing without being Lord of it: and it cannot be Lord of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuperiour unto it, and not that, unleſs it ſubject and ſubjugate it unto it ſelf. So as it is by ſo much more a poſſeſſor, by how much it is more Lord and Superiour. Now he who deſires to be rich, muſt needs love thoſe things, without which he cannot be rich: nor can he love them without care, ſollicitude, and ſlavery; but he who contemns them, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord, but Poſſeſſor of them. And for this cauſe St. <hi>John Climacus</hi> ſaid very well,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Grad.</hi> 17.</note> That the poor religious perſon, who caſts all his care upon God, is Lord of all the world, and all men are his Servants. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the true love of poverty doth not baſely cleave unto theſe temporal things; for all it hath or can have it reſpects nothing; and if it want any thing, it is no more troubled, than if it wanted ſo much dung and dirt.</p>
                     <p>But above all rewards is that of God, who is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt by poverty:<note place="margin">In Pſal. <hi>118.</hi>
                        </note> and in St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his opinion is that hundred-fold, which is received for what we leave. For as the Tribe of <hi>Levie,</hi> which had no part in the diſtribution of the Land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> received this promiſe from God, that he would be their Share and Poſſeſſion of inheritance: So with much reaſon unto thoſe, who voluntarily refuſe their parts in the goods of the earth, God himſelf becomes their poſſeſſion, riches, and all good even in this world; and paſſes ſo much further as to give them in the other the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.<note place="margin">Aug. Ser. <hi>28.</hi> de Ver.

Wilt thou ſee how rich and precious it is? The poor man buyes and obtains that by poverty, which the rich man cannot with all his treaſures.</q> And it was certainly a moſt high counſel in our Lord God, and an act
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:51068:293"/>worthy of his divine underſtanding to make Poverty the price of his Glory, that none might want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to purchaſe it. Wherefore many of the Saints have been ſo enamoured of Poverty, that they have purchaſed it with more eagerneſs, than the rich have fled from it, and have had this advantage over them, to be more voluntarily poor, than the other could be rich.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SO evident is the baſeneſs of temporal goods, and the miſchiefs they occaſion in humane life ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that many Philoſophers without the light of faith or doctrine of the Son of God were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it; and many ſo deeply apprehended the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance not onely of contemning, but renouncing of riches, that they lived moſt contentedly in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and moderation. <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> although a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſon in <hi>Athens,</hi> was ſo affected to poverty, that he alwayes went in a courſe broken Garment, hungry and neceſſitated; and though he had a friend of great wealth called <hi>Clinias,</hi> could never be perſwaded to accept the leaſt relief from him. It happened that this <hi>Clinias</hi> being accuſed before the Judges, to aggravate his other crimes, it was laid in his diſh, that being rich and able, he had not aſſiſted his friend <hi>Ariſtides. Clinias</hi> perceiving the Judges to be highly incenſed, and all men to cry out againſt his inhumanity, went to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and deſired him to defend him from that falſe calumny, and to ſatisfie the Judges and people how often he had offered his wealth and fortunes to ſerve him, and that it was he himſelf, who had ſtill
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:51068:294"/>refuſed it. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> did ſo; and informed the Judges of the innocence of his friend, and that it was his own deſire rather to live in his own poverty, than to brave it in the riches of another; ſaying withall, That rich men, who miſpent their fortunes, were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be found, but few who paſſed their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and want of neceſſaries with a generous mind; which ſo ſoon as he had declared, There was none preſent, who envied not more the poverty and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> then wiſhed the wealth of <hi>Clinias. Zeno,</hi> as St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> write, when news was brought him, That he had loſt all, anſwered, I ſee that Fortune will have me hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſs the life of a Philoſopher with leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reports of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that when he received the like news, all he ſaid was, If my goods had not periſhed, I had. <hi>Cato</hi> reports of <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> that he flung his ſubſtance into the Sea, ſaying, It is better I drown you, than you me. <hi>Diogenes</hi> left all he had but a wooden Diſh: and by chance ſeeing one drink out of the hollow of his hand, broke that alſo. <hi>Laertius</hi> writes, that one ſcoffing at <hi>Aeſchines</hi> a Philoſopher of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſaid, By the Gods, <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> I am ſorry to ſee thee ſo poor; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, By the ſame Gods, I pity thee for having ſo great riches, which thou haſt gotten with trouble, preſerv'ſt with care, ſpendeſt with grief, keepeſt with danger, defendeſt with a thouſand fears and paſſions; and which is worſt of all, Where are thy riches, there is thy heart.</p>
                  <p>This point is ſingularly well handled by St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> in his ſecond Book againſt the deſpiſers of a Monaſtick life,<note place="margin">Chryſ.

<pb n="571" facs="tcp:51068:294"/>others in all their power and Dominions. He relates alſo that of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> who being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a certain Council, could not come, becauſe his Cloak was in waſhing, and he had no other to weare: and yet was more eſteemed and reverenced by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than any of their Princes; from whence the holy Doctor inferres, That when there was no Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law, nor Examples of Saints, yet in natural reaſon, and by natural teſtimonies Poverty was of high eſteem and dignity.

                     <p>It is much to our confuſion, that the Gentils ſhould ſo far deſpiſe temporal goods, not being guided by that faith of Eternity, which we profeſs; The which gives ſo great a light unto the diſcovery of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is betwixt the one and the other, that many, whom it hath enlightned with the beams of truth, have not onely deſpiſed what the world holds in eſteem, but have ſought and embraced the contrary, rejoycing in poverty, ignominy, and auſterities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch actions to this effect, as have not fallen under imagination; whereof I ſhall here relate ſome admirable Hiſtories, and will begin with that of <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which we find written in certain Greek Commentaries.<note place="margin">Ex Cod. M. S. Graec. Biblioth. Vid. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derum <hi>2.</hi> P. opuſe. ſui Viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. c. <hi>3.</hi> pa. <hi>79.</hi>
                        </note> The Abbot <hi>Daniel</hi> going with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples unto <hi>Alexandria,</hi> beheld there, in company of other fools, this <hi>Mark,</hi> who went wholly naked, but where modeſty required ſomething to cover him, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing what was given him with many ſottiſh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures amongſt the other fools his companions. The prudent Abbot ſeriouſly marking him, preſently found by that ſpirit of trial, wherewith the Lord had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him, that this folly was Celeſtial wiſdom; and therefore meeting him the next day in one of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:51068:295"/>Market-places, he endeavoured to detain him, that he might ſpeak with him, but, he ſtill counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the fool, ſtrove all he could to get looſe and run away from him, inſomuch as the Venerable old man was fain to cry unto thoſe, who were preſent, to aſſiſt him: who, ſeeing a Monk ſtruggle with a Fool, cried out as faſt to him, to beware of the Mad-man. At laſt ſome Prieſts and Eccleſiaſticks, who knew the Abbot, paſſing by, asked him, What he had to do with the Fool, and what he would with him: Unto whom he anſwered, If you deſire to know, bring him before the Patriarck, and let him examine what he is. They did ſo, but <hi>Mark</hi> would neither anſwer nor ſpeak a word, until the Patriarck commanded him under an oath to declare Who he was, and what were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Then the counterfeit Fool, forced by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration to leave off his diſſembling, confeſt he had been a grievous ſinner, and had continued in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of life fifteen years, but by the goodneſs of God repenting his ſins, he had reſolved to perform as many years of penance, and had in a place convenient for the purpoſe ſpent eight of them; but deſiring to paſs the reſt of them in greater rigour and auſterity, he came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there to be treated in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they had ſeen him, in which he had now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued other eight years. Thoſe who were preſent could not out of tenderneſs refrain tears, and were much edified at the extraordinary wayes, by which the ſpirit of God recalls thoſe, whom he hath choſen. But their admiration was much encreaſed, when the next day the Abbot <hi>Daniel</hi> having ſent his Diſciple unto <hi>Mark</hi> to viſit him, and to adviſe him to return to the ſilence and ſolitarineſs of his Cell, he found him dead, and that he had already rendred his ſoul unto his Creator. Unto whoſe Interrement all the Monks and Prieſts of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with an incredible number of the People, repaired, praiſing the Lord for the marvailous works of his providence, that
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:51068:295"/>whom he had choſen to be deſpiſed and contemned in life, he had in this manner preſerved to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in death. Who ſees in not this admirable man a high contempt and renunciation of thoſe three kinds of goods, whch the world ſo much eſteems? He ſo deſpiſed Riches, as he had not a garment or ragg to cover his nakedneſs. He ſo much contemned Honour, that to the end he might be more humbled and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he converſed with fools, and made himſelf one of them; and ſo renounced all Pleaſures, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in perpetual faſts, forſaking and giving away his food amongſt his companions.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Ex M. S. Graec. Hiſt. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</note>Let us now relate another ſtory of equal fortitude in the contempt of the world, but in a weaker ſex. In <hi>Thabenna</hi> upon the banks of the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of 300 Virgins conſecrated to God, there was amongſt them one, called <hi>Iſidora,</hi> ſcorned, deſpiſed, and held for a fool by all the reſt: the which ſo nouriſhed that opinion, and in ſuch manner ſhewed her ſelf diſtracted, that ſhe did not for all this forbear ſo to exerciſe the works of charity, and humilliation towards the others, as if ſhe were a ſlave to each one of them. Her imployment was commonly in the Kitchin, where ſhe made clean and waſhed the diſhes. The others upon no occaſion would ſometimes buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet her, call her fool, ſot, and mad-woman: whereat ſhe either held her peace or laught like ſome ſimple Ninny, by which art ſhe freed her ſelf from ſitting with the reſt in the Refectory, not eating any thing, but the ſcraps and remainder of others. She went alwaies barefoot, with her head covered with ſome dirty cloth; and although ſhe were the ſcorn of all, yet ſhe was never heard to ſpeak any thing in her own defence, or ſhew the leaſt reſentment of any thing they did unto her.<note place="margin">Pallad. c. <hi>42.</hi> de S. Pitirum.</note> At the ſame time there lived in <hi>Porphirite</hi> that great man of penance, and of equal fame and goodneſs, called <hi>Pitirum,</hi> unto whom an Angel appeared, and ſaid, Thou haſt little reaſon
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:51068:296"/>to glory in thy ſo many yeares auſterity and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a religious life. Come and thou ſhalt ſee a Maid more holy then thy ſelf. Goe to the Convent of the religious in <hi>Thabenna,</hi> amongſt whom thou ſhalt finde one with a Diadem, (ſo the Angel called that foul cloth, which the humble Virgin, that ſhe might be more deſpiſed, wore about her head.) Know, ſaid the Angel, that this Maid is better than thy ſelf, her patience is daily excerciſed by a number of women, ſhe is deſpiſed, ſcorned, and treated as if ſhe were a dog, and yet permits not her thoughts to be troubled or diſtracted from God by any thing: And thou being here alone ſuffereſt thy thoughts to wander up and down the whole world. Which ſaid, the Angel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; And the Abbot <hi>Pitirum</hi> at the ſame time, in complyance with what was commanded, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words the place appointed, and being ſo famed for ſanctity, eaſily obtained leave to ſee the Monaſtery. And the Abbeſs and all the Nunns came forth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of ſeeing ſo ſingular a man for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, as alſo to receive the benediction of the Biſhop, who with one of his Deacons accompanied him. The Abbot not perceiving her amongſt the reſt whom he ſought for, demanded if none of the Religious were wanting: and they anſwearing, None, replyed, It is impoſſible; for I ſee not her, whom the Angel of the Lord ſhewed me. Whereupon they ſaid, There onely wanted one, who was a fool, and remained in the Kitchin. The Abbot commanded her inſtantly to be fetcht, which with much adoe (ſhe reſiſting all was poſſible) they did by force. The holy Abbot inſtantly knowing her by that covering, which the Angel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Diadem, fell proſtrate at her feet, ſaying, Mother, I beſeech thee bleſs me, and by thy holy prayers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me unto our Lord. The other religious aſtoniſht at the accident ſaid, Take heed, Father, what you do; This is a fool and deprived of her ſenſes. To whom the Abbot, It is you are fools; This is wiſer
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:51068:296"/>than you or I; and I would to God that at the day of Judgement I might be found in as happy a condition as ſhe. The Nunns amazed at what they heard, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the feet of the Abbot demanded pardon for the injuries they had done unto the ſervant of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their faults: One, the ſcoffing at her manner of cloathing, Another, her buffetting her, Another, her flinging water in her face, Another, her plucking her by the Noſe. In fine, none but had done her ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front or other. Whereupon the Abbot returned home much comforted, and the religious from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gave her ſuch reſpect, as was due unto her vertues. But ſhe, not enduring to be ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and eſteemed, left the Monaſtery, (for then encloſure was not of obligation, as now it is,) and went to ſome other place, where ſhe might be more deſpiſed, at leaſt her vertues not ſo much known. Who ſees not here the world trodden under foot by this religious Virgin, who lived with ſuch content, humiliation, and patience in the middeſt of ſo much poverty, eſteeming herſelf happy in being a ſlave and ſcorned by all?</p>

There he remained a long time, all tattered in apparel, and his face ſo beſooted, as he ſeemed as if he were a coal himſelf: inſomuch as he was eſteemed the moſt vile and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable perſon of the whole City. It happened that
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:51068:297"/>(their Biſhop being at the ſame time dead) St. <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> came thither, intreated by the Citizens to beſtow a Biſhop upon them; whereupon the people preſented unto him the moſt noble and learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their City, that he might out of that number make choice of whom he pleaſed. But the Saint ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them, that for ſo great a dignity, as that of Biſhop, they ſhould not onely look upon thoſe parts, which ſhine and appear glorious in the world, but upon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſanctity: and that therefore they ſhould alſo preſent unto him others, although of a meaner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

The Biſhop moved by God, hearing him named, commanded him to be called, And made him Biſhop: Our Lord cauſing him, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed himſelf, to be honoured of others, and placed him, who was hidden and covered under his own lowneſs and humility, upon the Candleſtick of his Church. And he after proved ſo excellent a Biſhop, and ſo perfect a follower of Chriſt, that he came to give his blood for his holy name, joyning to the Crown of a moſt holy life the Laurel of martyrdom.</p>

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:51068:297"/>as ſuſpecting that, what he did, might be to conceal his vertues, ſo ſoon as he had the leaſt inkling of it, he would preſently depart to ſome other place, where he might be free from knowledge or eſteem.

He contradicted it not, but was contented for Chriſts ſake to bear the infamy, until God was pleaſed, that the true Father of the Child ſhould be diſcovered; and in the mean time had ſo much charity towards her, who had laid that ſcandal upon him, that, ſhe being in great neceſſity and infirm of her child-birth, he ſecretly brought her to eat.

The firſt, being a Duke, deſiring to become poor for Chriſts ſake, left his wife and fortunes, and forſook his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The ſecond bidding alſo farewell unto the world, became an Hermite. The third was an Arch-Biſhop, who quitting his Biſhoprick entred into the Order of the Ciſtercians. The fourth, named <hi>Alexander,</hi> was the youngeſt of all his Brothers, and being now arrived at ſixteen years of age, his Father would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to take the Government of the Kingdom upon him; Which being underſtood by his Siſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi> who was twenty years old, ſhe called him aſide, and ſpake unto him in this manner. My moſt ſweet Brother, what is that thou meaneſt to doe? Thy elder Brothers have forſaken the things of the Earth to gain thoſe of Heaven, and wilt thou to gain this Temporal Kingdom, which they have left, loſe that which is eternal, and thy own Soul? <hi>Alexander,</hi> his eyes becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountains of tears, anſwered her in this manner. Siſter, what is it you adviſe me? I am ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute your commands without varying in the leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:51068:299"/>The holy Maid glad of his reſolution changed her habit, and both of them ſecretly leaving their Country came into <hi>France.</hi> There ſhe taught her Brother how to order a Dairy, milk Cows, and make Cheeſes, and after found a way to have him received into a certain Grange of the Ciſtercians, where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this office to ſuch ſatisfaction of the Monks, that in a ſhort time he was admitted amongſt them a Lay-Brother. His Siſter <hi>Matilda</hi> ſeeing him thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſaid one day unto him; Brother, certainly a great reward attends us from the Lord, for having thus left our Parents and our Country for the love of him. But we ſhall receive a far greater, if for the ſhort time of our lives we deprive our ſelves even of this content of ſeeing one another: and that we ſo give our ſelves over to that Divine and Soveraign Majeſty, that we meet no more, until we meet in Heaven, where we ſhall ſee and converſe one with another in true and eternal comfort. Here the Brother fell a weeping, apprehending this as the greateſt difficulty he had hitherto encountred in the whole courſe of his life. But at laſt he maſter'd it, and they both parted never to ſee one another more upon earth. The holy Virgin went unto a certain Town nine miles diſtant, where ſhe lived retired in a little Cottage, and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf wholly by the labour of her hands, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither preſent nor alms. Her Bed was the ground or little better; ſhe eat upon her knees, and in that poſture ſpent many hours in prayer: wherein ſhe often was ſo rapt from her ſenſes, that ſhe neither heard the noiſe of thunder, nor perceived the flaſhes of lightning. <hi>Alexander</hi> was never known whileſt he lived. But St. <hi>Matilda</hi> was nine years before her death: and therefore attempted often to have left the place; but was ſo ſtrictly watched, ſhe could not. She wrought many miracles both during her life and after death. A certain Monk ſick of an Impoſthume in his breaſt offered up his prayers at the Tomb of

                        <hi>Alexander;</hi> and to him the Servant of God appeared more reſplendent than the Sun, adorned with two moſt beautiful Crowns; The one of which he wore upon his head: The other he carried in his hand; And being demanded of the Monk, what thoſe two Crowns ſignified, he anſwered, This which I bear in my hands is given me for that temporal Kingdom which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook upon earth; The other of my head is that which is commonly given to all the Saints of Heaven. And that thou mayeſt give credit to what thou haſt ſeen in this Viſion, thou ſhalt find thy ſelf according to thy faith cured of thy infirmity.

                     <p> The love, which we owe unto God, ought ſo to fill our Souls, that it leave no place or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to love the Temporal.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have already produced ſufficient motives and reaſons to breed in us a contempt of the things of this world, and to wean our affections from them, as well for being in themſelves vile, tranſitory, mutable, little, and dangerous, as for that the Son of God hath done and ſuffered ſo much to the end we ſhould deſpiſe them. I will onely now add for the concluſion of this matter, That, though they were of ſome real worth or value, (as they are not,) yet for all this we ought not to love them, ſince ſo great is that love and affection, which is due from us unto God, that it ought ſo fully to fill and poſſeſs our hearts, that it leave no room for any other affection than it ſelf. For if it were commanded in the Law, when men had not the obligation which we now have, (the Son of God not having then died for our redemption)
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:51068:300"/>that we ſhould love him with all our heart, all our ſoul, and all our powers: how are we to love him, when our debt is ſo much greater, and that we have a further knowledge of his divine goodneſs? If then there ought to be no place for any love but his, how can we now turn our eyes unto the creature, or ſet our hearts upon it, when a million of hearts are not ſufficient for our Creator? There is no one Title for which God is amiable, but upon that title we owe him a thouſand wills, a thouſand loves, and all what we are, or can be; What do we then owe him for all together? Conſider his benefits, his love, his goodneſs, and thou ſhalt ſee, that though thou hadſt as many hearts as there are ſands upon the Sea-ſhore, or atoms in the Air, all were not capable of that great love, which is due unto him. How canſt thou then divide this one heart, which thou haſt, amongſt ſo many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Conſider alſo the multitude and greatneſs of his divine bleſſings, and deal but with God, as one man doth with another. If we ſay of humane benefits, that gifts break rocks, how comes it that divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits do not move a heart of fleſh?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.</note> And if, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayes, Thoſe who give gifts ſteal the hearts of the receivers, how comes it that God robs not thee of thy ſoul, who not onely gives thee gifts, but himſelf for a gift? Conſider the benefits thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in thy Creation; They were as many as thou haſt members of thy body, or faculties of thy ſoul. Conſider thoſe of thy Conſervation; Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as many, as there are diſtinct natures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth. The Elements, Stars, and the whole world were created for thy preſervation, without which thou couldeſt not ſubſiſt. Look upon the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. of thy Redemption; They are as many as are the evils of Hell, from which they have freed thee. Look upon thoſe of thy Juſtification; they are as many as the Sacraments, which Chriſt hath inſtituted, and the examples which he hath left thee. Think what thou
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:51068:300"/>oweſt him for having made thee a Chriſtian, pardoned thee ſo often, and given thee ſtill freſh grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thee. All theſe and a thouſand other benefits and obligations demand and ſue for thy love. And not onely theſe benefits from God, but even thoſe from men cry out unto thee to love him; For there is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which thou receiveſt from man, but comes from God. On all parts then, and for all things thou art obliged to love God; for it is he who does thee good in all, and is worth unto thee more than all. How comes it then, that, ſince he hath done all this for us, we yet think not what we are to do for him, nor how we ſhall expreſs our thankfulneſs for ſuch and ſo great benefits? <hi>David</hi> was troubled with this care when he ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I return unto the Lord for all which he hath given me?</hi> And yet the Lord had not then given him the Body and blood of his Son, nor had his Son then been born or died for him. Since then he hath done all this for us, why doe we not ſtudy how we may be grateful for ſuch infinite and unſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? But what can we return which we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Let us deliver him back our ſouls, hearts, and bodies: looking upon our ſelves hence forward, as on a thing not ours but his, acknowledging that we owe him more than what we are, or can do. So ſhall we not debaſe our love by placing it upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhall then conſider the infinite love which God bears us, we ſhall finde that we have no love left to beſtow upon any thing but him, no not upon our ſelves. To know truly the greatneſs of this divine love, we are to ſuppoſe that true and perfect Love conſiſts much in action, but is moſt apparent in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ſuffering, and alſo in communication of its proper goods unto thoſe whom it loves. See then how great is his love, who hath wrought ſuch ſtupendious works for thee, as are his Incarnation and thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and continues ſtill untill this hour working
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:51068:301"/>for thy good after a thouſand wayes in all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, making the Corn to grow which is to feed thee, the Wooll to encreaſe which is to cloath thee, ſupports the Sun which is to enlighten thee, draws Waters from the veins of the earth to quench thy thirſt, and in every thing ſtill operates for thee. Conſider how he gives a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Elements, life to Plants, ſenſe to Beaſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to Angels, and all to thee, working in thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone all which he works in the other degrees of nature. How apparent then is the love of God in his works, who does ſo great things for the good of man, who deſerves to be forſaken by him, and reduced to nothing? Conſider then the exceſs of love in his patience, who hath endured ſuch cruel torments, and ſo painful a death for thee, and hath born with thee as often as thou haſt offended him; And if patience be a tryal of love, where ſhall we find ſo great an example? How exceſſive were that love, if a King, who after his Vaſſal had a thouſand times attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to murther him, ſhould not onely pardon, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtil to favour and enrich him with his own Rents and Revenues? who would not be amazed at ſuch a love, and think that King infatuated? O goodneſs and longamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, who ſuffers us a thouſand times to turn again and crucifie thee our Redeemer, the King of Glory, and art ſtill ſilent! Behold alſo his love in communicating all the good he hath unto us. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delivers up his onely Son, the Son his Body and Blood for us, and they both together ſend the Holy Ghoſt, by whom we are by grace made partakers of the Divine Nature. See if a more great, more real, or more tender love than this can be imagined, wherein he ſhares with us all he has, and gives us all he can. And if love be to be paid with love, what love doeſt thou owe him? See if thou haſt an affection yet free to be imployed apon any but thy Lover and thy God. Requite then this exceſs of good will by having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will but his, and anſwer his love with a love like his, of works and patience. Our Lord is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:51068:301"/>we ſhould onely love him with our tongues, but reprehends thoſe, who cry unto him, Lord, Lord, and doe not what he commands: For even good words, if they want works, are condemned as falſe and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us love him then in earneſt; let us ſuffer for him, and communicate with him all we have. Let us not think to come off with this love <hi>gratis;</hi> it is to coſt us all is ours. If we love our God truely, who ſo much loved us, we muſt reſolve to loſe honours, wealth, and pleaſure in ſerving and requiting him.</p>
                  <p>Above all, if we conſider him to be God, who is infinitely beautiful, good, wiſe, powerful, eternal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, immutable, there is no heart poſſible, which can equal the love, which he deſerves for any one of thoſe Divine Attributes. What ſhall then his whole infinity deſerve, which eminently contains all the beauties and perfections of his Creatures either real or imaginable? for all are but as a drop in reſpect of an immenſe Ocean; all depend upon God, who ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his beauties and perfections to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they ſtill remain in himſelf after a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, and in ſuch ſort diſtributes them, as he parts not from them, but unites them all in one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perfection. From whence, as from a fountain, all that is good flows, and is yet ſtill in the Original in a more high and tranſcendent manner. And if men (as the wiſe man ſayes) admiring the beauty of ſome creatures, adored them as Gods, let them hence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how beautiful is the Lord of all things, ſince he who made them is the Author and Father of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And if they wonder at their force and vertue in their operations, let them know, that he who made them is more powerful than they; And by the beauty and greatneſs of the created, let the underſtanding climbe to the knowledge of the Creator: and hence collect, that if the effect be good, the cauſe muſt needs be ſo too; for nothing can give what it hath not; And therefore he who made things ſo beautiful, and ſo
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:51068:302"/>good, cannot chooſe but be moſt beautiful and moſt excellently good himſelf. So as if the imagination ſhould joyn in one piece all the good, and all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all creatures poſſible or imaginable, yet God were infinitely more perfect and more beautiful than that.</p>
                  <p>From hence it follows, that as God is infinitely perfect and beautiful, ſo he muſt be infinitely amiable; and if infinitely amiable, we are to love him with an infinite love: ſo as if the capacity of our heart were infinite, it were wholly to be employed in loving him. How can we then, ſince our hearts are limited, and the object infinite, ſpare any part of it for the things of this life? Beſides, ſuch is the lovelineſs of God, that we are not to love our ſelves, but becauſe he loves us; and if we are not to love our ſelves but for his ſake, how are we diverted to love other things for their own ſake? O infinite God! how doe I rejoyce that thou art ſo good, ſo perfect, ſo beautiful, the ſource and original of all beauty and perfection, as that I ought not onely to withdraw my love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from all other creatures, but even from my ſelf, and place it wholly upon thee, from whom my being, and all the good I have is derived, as the beams from the Sun, or water from the Fountain. For as the conſervation of the rayes, according to a myſtick Doctor, depends more upon the Sun than upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the current of the ſtream more from the Fountain than it ſelf: In ſuch manner the good of man depends wholly upon God, who is the Spring and Fountain of all his good and perfection; from whence it follows, that man, when he relies upon himſelf, is ſure to fall, and when he loves himſelf, loſes himſelf, but flying and abhorring himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelf, according to what is written in the holy Goſpel, <hi>He who loves bis life ſhall loſe it, and he who hates it in this world ſhall gain it for ever.</hi> Hence it comes, that we are now no more to look upon our
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:51068:302"/>ſelves as upon a thing of our own but onely Gods, depending both in our ſpiritual and corporal being from that infinite Ocean of being and perfection. Hence the Soul, finding it ſelf now free and unfetter'd, flyes unto God with all its forces and affections, not finding any thing to love and pleaſe it but in him, in whom the beauty and perfections of all creatures are contained with infinite advantages. When one hath once arrived unto this eſtate, how diſſonant and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoever his works be, the end, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, is ſtill the ſame, and he ever obtains what he pretends, if ſhutting his eyes to all creatures as if they were not, he looks at nothing but God, and how to pleaſe his Divine goodneſs, and that onely for it ſelf. It may be, that looking at the particular ends of each work, our actions may be in ſeveral conditions; ſometimes they are in beginning, ſometimes in the middeſt, ſometimes in the end, and oftentimes by impediments and croſs accidents, which happen, they acquire not what they aim at; but look upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of him who works, and they are ſtill in their end: For in what condition ſoever the work be, he who does it with this intention onely to pleaſe God, is ever in his end, which no bad ſucceſs or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can hinder. According to this which hath been ſaid, it is a great matter by Divine light to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at this knowledge, That all goods and gifts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from above, and that there is an infinite power, goodneſs, wiſdom, mercy, and beauty, from whence theſe properties, which are here below participated by the creatures with ſuch limitation, are derived. It is a great matter to have diſcovered the Sun by his rayes, and guiding our ſelves by the ſtream to have arrived at the Fountains head, or to have found the Centre, where the multiplicity of created perfections meet and unite in one. There our love ſhall reſt as having nothing further to ſeek; And this is to love God with all the heart, all the ſoul, all the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:51068:303"/>and all the powers. And as thoſe, who arrive at this happy ſtate, have no other care, no other thought, than to doe the will of God here upon earth with the ſame perfection it is done in heaven: So they have no other deſires, than by leaving earth to enter hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there by ſulfilling wholly the Divine will, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what was defective upon earth. Nothing detains them here but the will of God; they have nothing begun which is not ended; they are ever prepared; all their buſineſs is diſpatched, like thoſe ſervants, who are alwayes expecting their Lord, and ſtill ready to open the door, when he ſhall call. Let us then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves by withdrawing our love from all which is temporal and created: and placing it upon our Creator, who is eternal, let us love him, not with a delicate and an effeminate love, but with a ſtrong and manly affection, ſuch a one as will ſupport any weight, overcome any difficulty, and deſpiſe any intereſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be ſeparated from our beloved, break his Laws, or offend him though never ſo lightly. Let this Love be <hi>ſtrong as death,</hi> that it may look death in the face, and not flye from it: which when it ſuffers, it conquers. Let thy fire be ſo enkindled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if whole rivers of tribulations fall upon it, they may be but like drops of water falling upon a forge, which the flame drinks up and conſumes, and is not quenched, but quickned by them. Be above thy ſelf, and above all that is below; And if the world offer thee all, it is Miſtreſs of, to deſpoil thee of this love, tread it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy feet, and deſpiſe it as nothing.</p>
                  <p>To this love it belongs, To accommodate ones ſelf to poverty, Not to repine at hunger, nakedneſs, cold or heat, who as companions goe along with it, To ſuffer injuries meekly, To bear ſickneſs and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties patiently, Not to be diſmayed in perſecutions, To endure temptations with longanimity, To bear the burthens of our neighbours chearfully, Not to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:51068:303"/>with their thwart conditions, Not to be angry at their neglects, nor overcome by their ingratitude, In ſpiritual dryneſſes not to leave our ordinary devotions, and in conſolations and ſpiritual guſts not to forbear our obligations: Finally, that we may ſay with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the charity of Chriſt? tribulation? or diſtreſs? or famine? or nakedneſs? or danger? or perſecution? or the ſword? I am ſure, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, neither things preſent, nor things to come, neither might, nor height, nor depth, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
